/user_details?userid=0Se8OFrPpi6wE2TY2IVTLA,Eric N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"New Korean BBQ in downtown Montreal!During this pandemic, it's so great to finally be able to dine in some restaurant. I happened to pass by this new place and decided to give it a try.1st I want to point out this restaurant is doing all their best to keep us safe and healthy.They have a no mask no service rules, I literally saw them refusing customer because one of them didn't wear a mask!They also ensure social distancing where they keep empty tables where its to close to another. Well done!This is not a AYCE BBQ place so the food is on another level. You'll be treated with A class meat and ingredients. You can see the picture yourself. The meat are not marinated to which you can actually taste the freshness.Would it be flavourless? No, they added some little spice on it and most importantly it comes with side dishes and sauce.When you get there and if you're unsure what and how many to order, just ask the waiter for advice, they will recommend you their top choices.I find the portion and price are fair, especially in downtown areas.I kind of wish they have more hot appetizers to order, unfortunately choices are much.I ordered seafood pancake (who doesn't when you go to a Korean restaurant, right?) umm.. It was okay. We also ordered a Kim Chi fried rice, honestly I was never a fan of Kim Chi, let along Kim Chi fried rice... But OMG, it was so good, the rice is nicely cooked, no to saugy and with big chunk of pork as well. MUST TRY! Overall, I had an amazing experience, had fun and enjoy a very tasty meal with the wife.Will I go back? What do you think?The question is WHEN will I go back lol. Don't forget to call in advance to make a reservation!"

I made a reservation by phone 2 days before and we were set! Upon arrival, all the tables were distanced 2 m apart and the decor acted as a divider of every section in the restaurant. Every member of the Daldongnae team was extremely nice and attentive. We had an amazing service.We ordered 1 pork belly, 1 short rib & 1 rib finger. When we got our order, they seemed to have made a mistake and given us an extra meat order. We alerted a staff member, they apologized and offered to give the extra meat on the house. They were all very respectful and wore a mask.The side dishes came with the meat orders. They were all very tasty! We have also ordered the cold noodle and.... it is the perfect meal for a hot summer day! We were very happy about the service and the delicious food! I would definitely recommend people to come here. I felt that they do take precaution and respect the measures and procedures for covid-19."

I love how they give a large variety of side dishes. The place is nice and clean. Very good service as well! Definitely will be going back. Its now one of my top korean restaurants in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very happy about their meticulousness when it comes to safety. You'll encounter a temperature and mask check at the door and they'll also take down your name and number in case they need to reach you for contact tracing.Wall the trimmings are promptly brought to your table and the grill is set up. There were so many options! From sweet cheesy corn to seaweed salad, marinated cucumbers, potato & apple salad (which was a favorite along with the corn), kim chi, tofu soup, lettuce leaves, glass noodles and my favorite was the salty dipping oil. Any of these can be refilled if you want!The meat came on a cutting board. We ordered the boneless short rib which were cut in slices and the beef rib eye roll which was like a 6oz slab of meat that came with a pair of kitchen shears to cut them up after cooking. Both cuts of meat were good. We tend to like them lean so this was perfect. The soup was brought at the end and we couldn't finish it. It was a little too salty and we were full. I have a similar comment about the place being a little too dark. You have a 2 hr time slot for your meal. Overall, a good place to eat!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"As delicious as the one in Toronto!We ordered the pork belly, the ribs and the faux-filet. You need to order a minimum of 2 meats. It comes with an array of side dishes such as japchae, a stew, salad, sauce, cheese and corn, kimchi, etc. The meat quality was pretty good and we were full afterwards. The inside is very cozy and nicely decorated. They respect the 2m distance between tables and all employees wear masks which is great. Would definitely come back."
/user_details?userid=qfCHqKbLR48haYCM3As_AQ,Alex F.,"Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Highly recommend. It is a korean bbq chain from Toronto : they have several stores in the Greater Toronto area but this one is their first restaurant in Montreal. It is fairly pricey comparing to other spots in Montreal (we took pork belly 16.99$ & beef boneless short ribs 26.99$) but you get more than 10 varieties of side dishes (with free refills) including soft tofu soup, silky egg, cheese corn, garlic, marinated onions, 3 kinds of kimchi, japchae, lettuce, seaweed, etc. Overall, I think it's worth it to pay a bit more since you get the quality and quantity with it.They don't just serve kbbq, you can also order korean classics such as kimchi fried rice, stew, korean pancakes, stir-fried pork and rice (and more) to eat with your grilled meats. The only thing I didn't like was that the place is very dark, little lighting, but I understand it was for the mood and ambiance of the traditionnal kbbq restaurant.Highly recommend you try this place with your family and friends."

I have been to the ones in Toronto, thankfully, the food turned out to be as amazing as the one in Toronto. I love how they have so many side dishes because most of the k restaurants in town don't give as many as they do, the only problem is that things are a bit pricy, but worth it! Great stuff and great food, remember to reserve for the table before you go :)"
/user_details?userid=NilrQC1Lq7t2O1u_54sINQ,Audrey L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"The best Korean BBQ in Montreal, hands down. Sure, it's pricier than some of the AYCE spots on Ste. Catherine... but it's worth it. The quality of the meats is incredible, and great portions (though be warned: each order is meant for 2!) Get yourself a kimchi fried rice on the side, if you're really hungry!"
/user_details?userid=uYyfXuaimxhvRuT6hEtIWg,Gia Loc D.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,Trying out this new kbbq place on Bishop street downtown - @daldongnae.mtl * Great experience! Loved the numerous side dishes. Meat was tasty! Pricey but very much worth it. * Staff was extra kind and helpful. The exhaust fan is a big plus. Our clothes are not smelly. COVID preventative measures are in place so that's reassuring. * I would give it 8.7/10 Gia points  One thing I would change is the water. It wasn't cold enough and the cups are so tiny.
/user_details?userid=8G-frHRklrWp4nQsW71WJw,Adam A.,"Port Elgin, Canada",4 star rating,"The service was the highlight of my experience as the staff were very friendly and accommodating. The food was served quickly and was of good quality. Personally I prefer when the meat comes lightly marinated to add a bit more flavor, but the selection of dips did the trick. For meats were ordered pork skirt, pork belly, rib eye, beef short rib, and all in with a 20% tip the bill was $115, so not a bad price range for two people on a Saturday night out."
/user_details?userid=mJVwMXwWPEnYdSN8ftzVWQ,Lisa M.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The best KBBQ in Montreal ! We've been going there every week since their opening. The food is delicious and the staff are super nice. Specially Andy is always amazing at customer service, always making sure everything is good. I would definitely recommend this place !"
/user_details?userid=r1rXGkONazISD0_-VLNv3A,Yannick L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Awesome atmosphere and even better food! This is hands down the best Korean BBQ in Montreal right now. Super simple for ordering and comes with an abundance of all the sides needed such as spicy cucumber salad, corn and cheese, kim chee, mashed potatoes with pumpkin and more! The waiters and manager showcase exemplary service to have a great night. I cannot recommend enough! Only thing to keep in mind is that the wait times can be long if you come during peak hours and you'll have to wait at the door."

The taste and quality of all the food and side dishes were amazing and it has become my favourite Korean resto in Montreal! I always recommend this place to others whenever they're looking for a Korean place to eat. :))"
