/user_details?userid=05AH2UJKDAxTcJVOy3XPIg,Mohamed A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The original location of this growing chain(3branches and counting). Still keeping the original ""no frills"" vibes. Delicious and authentic, 100% middle eastren clientele.The ambiance and service can be a little too basic though(and limited space/seats), which i personally don't mind."
/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"With Turkey being one of my most favourite countries (having visited more than 5 times) it is no surprise that I love the cuisine.Having heard many good reviews about Maison Istanbul, I was excited to make the long trip from the South Shore to the restaurant. The exterior and interior are both very simple and look like a typical 'fast-food' joint with some parking out front. Inside there is plenty of seating and is relatively clean. There are a lot of options to choose from, from sandwiches and pizzas to meat plates and pide (Turkish pizza bread). We were starving so ordered a Donner Meat Plate and a Mixed Kabab Plate. The portions were very large and both of us were unable to finish! The donner meat was very moist and delicious, served the authentic way with bulgur rice, Turkish bread, salad and fries. I asked for some of their homemade sauce that they serve with the Adana Kabab (I think) which they happily provided a good warmed portion of - it went really well with the meats as I find gyro/donner a bit on the dry side. My husband loved the mixed kabab plate which was full of flavour.I found the plates a bit on the pricier side as everything was quite basic and you would expect to pay that much at a slightly more fancier restaurant. However, I would definitely return if in the area as the food was very tasty and authentic."

/user_details?userid=Iu5mS8o02-RGpjJdxI0v7w,Harry K.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here upon a recommendation of a Turkish friend and only to try the Iskender kebab. This was something I'd never had before so wanted to find out what the whole fuss was about. I'm guessing it's a very popular kebab with Turkish people. The rest on their menu is all too familiar for me. Hence my little trip all the way there was justified lol. The place itself is an OK place, casual, laid back and full of Turkish vibe. Big screen TV playing on moderate volume, you can hear all kinds of Turkish music. Not a bad place for a casual lunch or dinner in general. My Iskender kebab gets a 4 star. I wasn't wowed and wasn't disappointed either. My friend warned me saying what you get here in terms of taste vs the one offered in Turkey, specifically in the city of Bursa.... big difference. Ah well, I'm not travelling to Turkey for that so going to settle with this. Overall, I was satisfied with my dish, basically it's a mix of two kinds of meat, lamb and beef gyro style laid on top of bed of what looked like Afghan bread, cut into bite sizes topped with tasty tomato sauce. I think this is the only kebab you eat with plain yogurt and again I have to check online to see if this is the authentic way of doing it. Portion was good but $16 plus tax and tip which comes to $21 and change with no drink, I found it to be just a little overpriced. I'm guessing because it contains lamb meat. It loses one star though for missing paper towel dispenser in the washroom, salt, pepper and napkins not found on every table and also staff not attentive. I wasn't even asked if I wanted to drink something nor offered a standard glass of water. Overall, I'd stop by here again if in the hood to try other food. Where I come from, they're all too similar to me but sure theirs has a different twist. Recommend? Yes. Worth the discovery."
/user_details?userid=o_IEnOVNuir0QNVkANzyXQ,Esteban Y.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Excellent Turkish place, the real deal, the food is just like in Turkey. I have already been here twice and will come back again to try the rest of their menu. I have had so far the Iskender Kebab and the shish taouk kebab, very good. I have tried as well the lentil soup, yummy just like grandma's do it in Turkey. And their Kunefe was awesome, which is a dessert made with cheese pastry soaked in sweet, sugar-based syrup. The service is very good as well, they are very kind. The place itself is not great looking, not super charming but you still feel the warmth from Turkey. If you are around the neighborhood it is worth trying their food. By the way, their mixed platters are looking amazing, so I'm definitely going for that next time. They also mentioned me that soon they will open a new place that will look way better, so looking forward to that."

/user_details?userid=CFB9glegliFCT7dJxdLNsA,Jawad K.,"Saint-Hubert, Canada",5 star rating,Amazing restaurant cozy and warm. The staff is nice and helpful. The portions are HUGE ! The meats are fresh and you just feel a burst of flavors in every bite you take. Very nice grilled veggies (tomato and jalapeno) are served with every plate. The rice is filling and well spiced. Its not around the corner for me but for sure worh to visit again.

/user_details?userid=yyhzB-HRh-LQ6TBERHO27w,Irfan A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious authentic Turkish cuisine. The meat are cooked to perfection! The rice tastes phenomenal with the platter of beef, chicken and lamb. The price is very reasonable! Must try if you are in the area."
/user_details?userid=FceMxC3YvRH4WGYWY00UqQ,Ersin O.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,Incredible food with amazing service. Would highly recommend this place. I've been to many Turkish restaurants and this by far is my favorite. Try it for yourself and you won't be disappointed.
/user_details?userid=oHEQCwTSxau6urm2pCCKWQ,Edward O.,"Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Food tasted good , but after 2 bites I ate some hair , after a while I found 2 plastic paper in my food . The meat have too much fat and weird white jelly around that it's discussing . The staff didn't care when I told them . **I got food posing eating there** ."
/user_details?userid=_ixysN2OsPrT-xKNSgGoiQ,Sanaki R.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Food is delicious especially the lamb kebab dinner, specialty soups, and lahmaajoun but the last visit was unbelievable.  1 order was forgotten and never acknowledged until 45 minutes.  Asked for water twice with zero result.  Waitresses were tired, slow, rude, unhygienic, defensive, and spacey.  Terrible service and the place was 1/3 full.  Delivery more worthwhile but be aware the prices have been jacked up in comparison to their previous locations."
/user_details?userid=0rkFGJHpflWn6udZPZFIuw,Maria M.,"Des Moines, IA",4 star rating,"Authentic Turkish food that ranks high in taste and quality yet inexpensive. For customers who are averse to French fries, the server offers more salad."
/user_details?userid=SSCp43W_X3MasY7gF3hhGg,Mirkan C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The food here is great, the surrounding is great too. The owner is friendly and so are the workers. It's a must try if you're in the area and they even do delivery!I first tryed this Turkish kebab called ""Adana"" it's ground meat but the flavor of it was rich and juicy, it came with rice, salade, and fries. They also have pizzas, poutine, fries, etc. and the pizza is I would say top 5 in the saint-Leonard area!"
/user_details?userid=luTxcIu9WJe3G_DBuCPirg,Terra L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,We are visiting Montreal this weekend and we wanted kebab. So this was the closest place to our hotel. It's now 10:55pm and we are so full! The portions are huge and staff is great. We have chicken doner dinner and paca soup first that was just lovely! We come back again!
