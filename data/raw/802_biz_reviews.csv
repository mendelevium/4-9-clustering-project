But this place still has it's own charm! I like that you get an actual meal here and not just the sandwich. You can get a side of rice, salad, fries, poutine, potatoes. It's really great! The chicken is good and the sandwich is filling. If you get it with the fries it's a great lunch."
/user_details?userid=Mb_uxo2qbFtJdFEMsFanwA,Javed S.,"Ashburn, VA",5 star rating,Looks can be deceiving from the outside but inside it is  really a 5-Star place and out of this world quality.  Really home cooked and transformed us to the old European country.

I've been getting the 2x chicken leg set--leaves me super full and satisfied! You get a salad with the meal. I also like swapping the fries for potatoes. It costs roughly $16 after tax. There is a mason jar of piri piri sauce for you to lather onto your chicken with a brush if you dine in. If you take your food to-go, they'll give you a little container of it. It's super yummy!"
/user_details?userid=wOC-dzrZRoJSVqeZSf9Xhw,Jeff R.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Easily the best chicken and fries I've had in Montreal.  Everything gluten free including the hot sauce (separate fryer for fries).Super moist, flavorful chicken with crispy skin.  Fries are fcking amazing and have a trace sweetness to them that makes it impossible not to finish the entire plate.  Enjoy!"

/user_details?userid=dSyC1rlanwac4peWtcKCMg,Eamonn D.,"Lennoxville, Sherbrooke, Canada",3 star rating,"When I first walked in I looked at the menu and saw two things that caught my eye, the portugese chicken and the chorizo. Now, I like both of those things and so when it came to choosing what I wanted to eat the Poutine seemed like a good choice because it contained both (and it was a poutine too so that was a plus). While waiting for the food the waiter brought us over this delicious bread and butter. and then that's when the poutine came over. It was't bad, but it also wasn't amazing. The fries were great, gravy tasty, loaded with cheese curds, but what it wasn't loaded with was chicken and chorizo. I was okay with the amount of chicken (not impressed, but okay), and there was very little chorizo and it was quite dry. The waiter was also a lovely guy might I add, good customer service. tldr; not a bad joint, could use more meat in their poutine, chorizo a little dry, good customer service. I would come here again if a friend wanted to, but I would check out other places in the area first."

The chicken is delicious with a nice crispy skin; just like a Portugaise tanning in Cuba. The piri piri sauce comes on the side, so you get to oil up your own chicken just like when your at home alone . They real highlight was the service. Our waiter, Chris, was so good he made the chicken taste even better.  That man is a Legend!"

/user_details?userid=JMP9JY5JV2HfWn8ClTBb6A,Matthew T.,"Bradenton, FL",4 star rating,"Walking up and down St. Viateur during vacation I saw this place with tons of people on the patio and good smells coming out of the front door.  Plus the sign out side said grilled sardines!  And lets just say good grilled sardines can be hard to fine in the states, so that put the nail in and we decided to go one night.  IT was raining that day, so no patio, but service inside was good.  Started with the house red as well as I know very little about Portuguese wine and figure this would be a good way to start trying them, and it was good and very reasonably priced.  WE got the sardines of course, they were nicely done and tasty.  Fairly typical to my mind for the dish, but very happy to gave them.  We also tried the chicken and lamb combo.  Figured that way would get a few tastes of things.  The lamb was cooked nicely, tender and properly seasoned.  A real winner.  I thought the chicken was very good.  Other reviewers have complained about the chicken here, but mine was moist and had a good flavor.  From reading I know there is a real cult of Portuguese chicken going on with people's favorites and such, so I can't really compare to any place else, but standing on its own I thought it was very good.  But know what the real secret here is?  The pepper sauce.  That thing is amazing!  Great flavor and a dab on either the meats or the potatoes gave things a nice smokiness.  That sauce is money in a jar!  If I thought I could get it through customs I would have gotten a jar as they do sell it separately to go here!  Heck at the very least stop in and grab a jar to try at home."
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Location: On St. Viateur, west of the main. Off the top of my head, the closest subway is probably Laurier (check the map) - street parking available, but metered. Watch out for those residential zones.The place: Tiny. Get there early or make a reservation. In terms of its overall look and feel, the rotisserie is average and nothing to write home about.The food: My personal opinion is that Mile End is mediocre. I wasn't blown away by the chicken - I found it a little tough and there wasn't any moistness to it. In terms of flavour, meh - nothing special. There was nothing that stood out or made my taste buds quiver with excitement. Instead of fries, I had the rice (I know, who does that?). Wow. The rice was white - that's it, that's all. No veggies, no chicken broth and zero flavour. Would not repeat that experience. The bread and salad that are great though. The salad was fresh and crispy and the bread was soft and tasty.Service: Average to mediocre. When we asked if we could sit at another table (this was before we even sat down at the original table), the waiter gave my friend this look then literally threw the menus onto the new table. Really buddy? The table was right behind you - it's not like you had to walk a mile to reach it. This same waiter proceed to rub his arse against my chair all night, which wasn't annoying at all.  Service is also very slow. Price point: I think a breast and side is about $12."

Every time we don't know what to make for supper, Mile-End is the place to go. The chicken is some of the best Portuguese-style chicken in the city, hands down. I usually order it with fries or their roasted potatoes. Their homemade hot sauce is tasty and unique. Other tasty dishes include the ribs and traditional salted cod (Bacalau). Don't forget to have a Nata for desert, sprinkled with cinnamon and heated in the oven. Love this place. :)"
/user_details?userid=lvrtql74NXkNQQ8TuroWfw,Alejandro S.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Montreal has so many great restaurants but we like coming here for one simple reason, great food. Whenever we are in Montreal we always make the effort to eat at Rotisserie Mile End because the food is always fresh and you never leave there feeling like you didn't eat enough. I personally love their calamari dish and the grilled sardines, but quite often I order their open flame grilled chicken with either fries or their home made roasted potatoes. You get Portuguese bread and salad with your meal. They have a small but very yummy selection of Portuguese pastries, like the traditional natas. If you want an affordable but yummy meal then you have to pop in and eat there. The owners Nelson and Grace are usually there and they will make your visit a very welcoming one."
/user_details?userid=1yred0iW-fTxLNytyltTtQ,Jorge A Z.,"Brossard, Canada",1 star rating,"Rotisserie Mile End, where to start. I had a whole chicken portuguese style, it was tasty but dry. Overall good, but had better at Romados.Had an entree of calamari and what a surprise, paid 6$+ for one tiny piece. I noticed when I got home, because I took it for takeout. Will not go back, 28$ for a chicken and a tiny calamari. I get better value and quality at Romados or even St-hubert chicken."

/user_details?userid=qUqyWV4DnxEChu1xk24DqA,Melissa A.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Superb grilled chicken - amazingly crispy skin, excellent with rice or chips. The salad and peri-peri sauce are both great as well. We've eaten at a few different Portuguese places in Montreal and this stands out as a fave. Service can be a little slow, but the food is worth the wait. Really nice on the terrace in the summertime too."
