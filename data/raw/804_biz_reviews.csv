They missed two poutines on my delivery order, I called in and they said they would bring them to my home. The guy never showed up, and when I called back they were closed. The next day I called again and they refused to give me my poutines and told me to call Uber. What a terrible experience."
/user_details?userid=tIMtx-4sdvevt8XlRFMyVQ,Ruth D.,"Minneapolis, MN",5 star rating,Had the chicken and rice from here tonight and it was great! I have never had Portuguese fair before so I don't have anything to compare it to but it was really good! SadI'm just in Montreal for a visit otherwise I would become a regular! Yummy!
/user_details?userid=qZlNNWCypJI2FOu0_0-OTQ,John M.,"Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,"It's pissing rain today and I ducked in here just as I got off the Metro (Mont-Royal) and I'm overjoyed that I gave this crowded little greasy spoon a chance, because it was fantastic. I got the chicken sandwich ""assiette"" with fries for $10. SOLID. I chose the spicy sauce and so should you. The bread- as soon as I touched it, I knew I was on Quality Street. Stunningly good, dense, chewy but soft, just a perfect vehicle for the VERY spicy, moist sandwich. As good as it was, the fries were simply next level, and this is in a city that has, by far, the best fries in North America. No city in the US or Canada can touch Montreal fries, and these were...no words. Even the accompanying salad was good, no nasty iceberg lettuce, just good romaine, good tomato slices (a miracle in mid-October), good simple vinegary dressing."
/user_details?userid=0Se8OFrPpi6wE2TY2IVTLA,Eric N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"One of the best Portuguese chicken you can get in town. Yes it is a fast food place but you won't be disappointed with the quality. They have varieties of choices for you to choose; from legs, to quarter, half or full chicken. They also have Portuguese chicken sandwich and chicken nuggets... For sides they have salad and home cuts fries! I always go there when I have the crave... If you can take spicy then you must have your chicken with their spicy sauce. Oh oh... Dont forget to wrap up your meal with their natas!!"
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The food here reminds me of Nandos. Their chicken sandwich is my favourite item on the menu. The chicken is cooked to perfection and has a charcoal smokey flavour. Add sour dough bread and hot sauce to the equation and it makes the sandwich absolutely delicious. It has definitely become a regular spot for me over the past few months. Based on my consistent experience even after ordering the same thing of the menu for months, I think this place deserves 5 stars. The service is friendly and efficient too!"

/user_details?userid=NtyZOPiEDsrEIZAYlEVmWg,Marlene M.,"Arlington, VA",4 star rating,"After a 10 - hour train ride from New York to Montreal - on which I ate all but a cold, salty chicken caesar wrap and a mini bag of Planters almonds - Rotisserie Piri Piri was a godsend. Of course I see ""Portuguese chicken"" on the sign and I immediately think Nando's. But luckily, all the two have in common is the ""Piri Piri"" in their names. The chicken at Rotisserie was delicious - crispy skin, succulent meat, roasted to perfection.  Served with a heap of rice that was also super savory (I actually ravaged that first before I moved on to the chicken) and a simple garden salad. Ridiculously generous portions - perfect for a very hungry, very tired girl.  Overall, a good dinner spot for my first night in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=lpBBeJeKSXruAV__40s0XQ,James G.,"Saint Paul, MN",4 star rating,"For a quick/decently priced bite of Spicey piri piri peppered chicken, this is definitely a good spot. Fast food style, so in and out. I personally find it better than the other piri piri's in mtl. The poutine is not very good imo, better off with the potatoes/rice/fries."
/user_details?userid=qnZkCGvLz6AB5cQN_J_pUA,Jack D.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",2 star rating,"I really want to like this place. Like, I've come here at least 3 times in the hopes that it would get better. The setup is great if you don't have much time, the staff is lovely, and the location is ideal. That said, the chicken is... Mediocre. Unmemorable. Something about the sauce doesn't sit well with me. But compared to my other favorite Portuguese chicken spots, food-wise this place doesn't compare one bit. Maybe next time I'll try it without the sauce. Which kinda misses the whole point, no?"
/user_details?userid=WkAiFAJMI7aZPjFqMvsGbA,Sarah R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Yum!! Reviews don't seem to be as good as some of the other favourites, but I really enjoyed my meal, and the location is great! I was able to get two meals out of the 1/4 chicken meal. Chicken was perfectly cooked. The spicy sauce could have been a bit more spicy. The fries were well cooked and seasoned. I definitely recommend finishing off your meal with an egg tart!"
/user_details?userid=aj9ucN-8XSUCX8wWuddEdQ,Samantha M.,"Halifax, Canada",4 star rating,"Went here twice during our visit to Montreal and were not disappointed. We went to Romados the day before and decided we definitely still had a craving for Portuguese chicken, but felt bad about going to the same place two days in a row... Piri Piri was a great alternative! I ordered the chicken sandwich and rice, and my boyfriend ordered a chicken sandwich and fries. I'm also now obsessed with egg tarts and bought one for both me and my boyfriend. Piri Piri is comparable (menu wise) to Romados but also different in a lot of ways. The fries were solid, hand cut and tossed in a garlicky seasoning. I noticed they had these potato balls that everyone seemed to be ordering, I for some reason did not order them and am now regretting that decision. The chicken sandwich itself was quite good too, they use the same crusty roll Romados does (which I actually find is too much bread), but I liked the sauce quite a bit more here. I found the hot sauce at Romados to be more like a chili oil, but the sauce here is almost like a cream sauce (although I don't think it contains any cream). The hot sauce was not as hot as I had anticipated but still delivered a nice kick. The only negative would be that they used a lot of dark meat, while Romados used mostly white meat. There was more fat in this sandwich that I had to pick out. The egg tart was good. MMMMM. Man I love those things. I could sit down and eat a box with a hundred of them. The service here was great, everyone had a smile on their face and were very patient while answering my 100 irritating questions. I went back the next day on the way home after receiving disappointing food at a neighbouring restaurant (review to follow), and the experience was the same. Can't go wrong for under $10."

/user_details?userid=9DRiWsAzhbi5-Iu4By3ovA,Katy P.,"Lancaster, PA",5 star rating,"Absolutely amazing food. I've only ever had the chorizo sandwich and the chicken sandwich, both spicy, which I prefer to plain. So, so delicious. Flavorful, hot, and filling, at a great price. I haven't had a whole serving of potatoes to myself--but I've picked a few from a friend's plate, and they're fluffy, tomato-y, and go perfectly with the sandwich. They also use Portuguese rolls, which (understandably) are made for these sandwiches--hearty but not dry or overwhelming. You never get that all-bread bite. I also love the fruit juice sodas they have (similar to Orangina).I could only complain about the size of the dining room. It's both take-out and dine-in, but since I don't live nearby, I sometimes have to linger for a moment and hope someone leaves before my order comes up."

/user_details?userid=0KZNZKVCTpURutG_qbMKzg,Alejandro A.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"This is one of my favorite places for Piri Piri chicken sandwiches. The chicken is always well seasoned and I love their sauce. However, throughout the years I've noticed a change in quality since the administration changed. The fries are not as good as they used to be and something in the seasoning of the fries definitely changed and not for the better. The chicken still tastes as good as it did when i fist when in there almost a decade ago so I am thankful for that."

Needless to say i wont be coming back here. Cold and horrible service. The pork tasted good but theres was so many grease chunks it was pretty awful to chew. They also charged me extra for a sandwich i did not order. The quality of the meal does not make up for the service.

Any who, you can't go wrong with the quarter chicken platter. And if you go half chicken, I like your style and we should hang out sometime. Oh, their sandwiches are also pretty shmangin'."

/user_details?userid=Sg_BvnTHsbc1AABiJjaiPA,Vivian H.,"San Francisco, CA",2 star rating,"Seeing so many Portuguese rotisserie chicken places all over the city, we picked this spot near the Mt Royal metro stop to try for a quick dinner. I was almost going to go for their pork specialty dish until further inquiry led to me staring at little pig heads. No pig heads tonight, just chicken please. The chicken platter was filling, coming as with every other dish served in Montreal, a mountain of fries (and some salad). Meh, it was okay. Not very flavorful, kinda needed the chili oil slathered on for some Portuguese-ness. Service not very friendly, meh."

/user_details?userid=0TJ01iwzVLXtr_EYcfqoWQ,Offer R.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Canada",3 star rating,"Stopped there tonight on my way home and got a whole chicken to go. It's good. don't get me wrong. It's one tasty chicken. However, I am a little disappointed by the sauce.  It's definitely not Romados. On the plus side, they gave me a couple of sauce boxes to take away - that's something I miss sometimes. The wait was a bit long considering there were just two people in front of me in line. the staff didn't seem to hurry, and took their time serving me. I had hoped to find a  Portuguese restaurant with some soul, because the only downside to Romados is the service - they just throw it in a box and throw it at you - but I didn't find it here.  The location is relatively convenient, but I would probably go to any other chicken place given a choice."

/user_details?userid=mETeh3fKTV6TkJMB3aTx9Q,Sarah W.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I went there with a friend on a Sunday night. We both had 1/4 chicken, i took a side of veggie rice and my friend took a side of poutine. We both found the chicken to be extremely dry, they were so cheap on the sauce i barely had any even on the chicken skin. The rice was okay but lacked seasoning and my salad had lettuce so old the leaves had dark greyish spots on them. My friend ate her poutine but said the sauce was tasteless and the fries were very soft.Compared to Romados, the portions were ridiculously small, the limp salad taking half the plate, leaving little room for the rest.I would give the food a 4/10. The service was almost nonexistent and rude. Also, if you're going to drink water, bring your own water bottle because theirs are overpriced, like everything else on the menu is for the mediocre quality you get.I would definitely not recommend it. Better walk a bit farther and go to Romados next time."
/user_details?userid=oOfu-75wAzAoAPKzmloHeA,Noah S.,"Great Neck, NY",3 star rating,"I wasn't too impressed by this place, even though it looked amazing. This place is a Portuguese takeout/eat-in type places that is perfect for a quick lunch. The menu is pretty simple and is somewhat inexpensive. The have different cuts of chicken along with numerous sides, beef, and small plates. I was hungry so I wanted a half chicken. Instead, I got a quarter. I couldn't do anything about it because I had already payed for mine without realizing the slight difference in price. It was disappointing, but I forgave them. I also ordered mine spicy, which was yet another mistake because my chicken was very bland. The spicy chicken, which someone else in my party ordered, was great and flavorful. The chicken alone didn't have any authentic Portuguese flavors. There wasn't much seasoning and the texture was a bit off. Their rice was fantastic along with those potato balls. I did leave the restaurant somewhat full, but I was still craving more of the spicy chicken because I did enjoy that kind."
/user_details?userid=Us2SAI8BAAr9SBAI6w7aGQ,Emmanuel I.,"Edmonton, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm a huge fan of Piri Piri. It's your standard rotisserie, and you get a ton of great fries. It's a nice clean environment and the staff is very friendly. Their hot sauce is hotter than some of the other rotisserie locations in le Plateau, so for me that puts it over the edge over the competition.  The chicken and ribs are very flavorful so go there hungry."
/user_details?userid=HmYj8wXXzzmc80DIenufuw,Sherry S.,"Manhattan, NY",1 star rating,"This is a place owned by former (disgruntled) employees of Romados.Unfortunately the chicken is not as good as Romados (but even Romados is crap now).It was dry, definitely from the day before, and when she made the fries fresh, they weren't even cooked properly (read: raw). YUCK.No Sumol Laranja to buy (absolutely unthinkable in a Portuguese restaurant), and frankly, I will not be coming back to eat here.Maybe it's better in the summer with more customers, but damn did it ever suck."

The girlfriend grew up in Australia, so Piri Piri Chicken is something of a homecoming (Nandos?) for her. We popped in just to ease the hunger pains of walking around all day.Well, it's a cheap rotisserrie chicken joint. I'm giving it 2 stars, because, well, it was just not that great. They loaded up the plate with overcooked fries, salad drenched in who knows what (it was just wet and sour...) and the chicken was WAY bland. No spice. No sauce. No Nothing. Just bland."

/user_details?userid=C9z04s9HhssHZ_Rd8QnVsQ,Ana B.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I just had to leave a review after seeing the low ratings it has as it stands. We wandered in because it was the most promising option in the area at around noon today. We went for the chicken and chorizo sandwiches. We also added the fries and salad for $2.99 to one of the sandwiches. Both sandwiches were quite tasty and generous in size. The fries and salad were good as well. Two hungry people - and we had leftovers. Total price was less than $20 and there is water and sauces you can help yourself to. It was a pleasant place to eat, good for people watching and comfortable. The highlight were the 2 ladies who served us. They made sure we understood the French menu and were happy to explain the options to us. Very pleasant and lovely! I wish I lived in Montreal so I can go here again and again. Another couple in the restaurant ordered what looked to be a chicken dish in a large serving plate with some beans and rice. I would like to go back and give that a try, it looked amazing."

Everything was very oily, even the salad. The chicken was nice, and not dry at all. Overall not exactly gourmet or diet food, but if you are on a budget you get a good deal. The portions are more than generous, and you can have as many potatoes or fries as you want.The service was very friendly, but a little slow."

I usually go to the one on Masson for my Portuguese chicken cravings! The chicken was nice and saucy, and the potato balls were just as grand as the ones on Piri Piri Masson. I heard people saying it wasn't as good but I was positively surprised! It turns out that Piri Piri Masson bought out the one on Plateau and that's why the food is just as finger licking good!"

/user_details?userid=sFJjEc7ytSUV28Y7PpdMjQ,Mathieu B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Karma-wise, I need to re-adjust the score of this great place.It's at least a 3 1/2 - 4 stars. I think we must take things in perspective. On the corner of Mont-Royal and St-Denis  they're always been a Deli, a Fast Food, an Libanese fast food (Amir) and where Piri Piri was, another poor competition to the Amir. I went there when there was the Vente de Trottoir and we needed something cheap but good. We need to understand that, yes, it's only a fast food but it's a damn good one. I know there's like 1 gazillions Portugese restaurant on St-Laurent or even on Rachel but Piri Piri offers some GREAT sandwich with a salad and HOME FRIES. I don't know for you, but for me it makes me way happier to have home fries. 12-15$ and you got yourself a pretty decent grilled mealed. Pour des raisons de Karma je dois ré-ajusté le score de ce bel endroit car c'est au moins un 3 1/2 - 4 étoiles. Je pense qu'Avant tout c'est une question de perspective du coin Mont-Royal et St-Denis. Combien de fois on s'arrête au coin de ce populaire coin de rue quand on marche de le plateau. Toujours! Il y a le Deli qui est là depuis un bout, un fast food pas génial, un Amir pis un autre simili restaurant libanais. Maintenant il y a le Piri Piri qui nous offre d'excellente grillade portugaise. Principalement reconnue pour ses grillades et son approche simple de la cuisine, les restos portugais sont superbe. J'ai été durant la Vente de troittoir du Mont-Royal et pour 12-15 dollars un sandwich au porc, spécialité portugaises un peu piquant avec une salade et une généreuse portion de frites maison. Je ne sais pas pour vous, mais pour moi ça compte l'aspect «Frite Maison» parce que je trouve qu'un restaurateur qui prend le temps de blanchir ses frites pour offrir un meilleur plat. C'est faire l'Effort supplémentaire! J'aime bien la présence d'un resto portugais familial a cette intersection! C'est juste un bon changement. Thai Express, Deli, Fast Food et Piri Piri... Même dire le nom du Resto c'est le fun! Piri Piri!"

It's been a long running debate in my house of Romados vs. Piri Piri and I think we've all finally settled on Piri Piri as the winner. The chicken has more flavor, the sauce is spicier, there are way more options. Although all you really need is the chicken. And fries and rice and potatoes."
