/user_details?userid=0i47fbH2TiuPhpTnEm5o5w,Gabriel M.,"Annandale, Annandale, NJ",5 star rating,"Probably the best grilled chicken I've ever had. Upon planning my trip to Montreal, I was recommended to try the Portuguese rotisserie from a place called Romados, so I put it in my itinerary. However, I arrived during Christmas time so the restaurant was unfortunately closed , but one of the taxi drivers I rode with advised me to try Sparta's Greek chicken on Saint Catherine St. I am very happy that I listened to him.I don't know what they season their chicken and fries with, but it was arguably the best thing I had in Montreal. The chicken was so damn juicy and flavorful, you can tell their recipe has been perfected. The fries are just as good in my opinion; they were somewhat soggy but the sheer flavor completely negated the sogginess. In fact, the sogginess added to the experience imo - since I was starving -  the flimsiness of the fries made it easier to devour them. Come here for the chicken and fries, you will not regret it."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Got the souvlaki trio. The wrap was delicious and very juicy. The sauce was so flavorful and the wrap was soft and warm. The chicken was pretty tender as well. The fries however were very dry and flavorless so it was a bit disappointing. It came with a soft drink and cost me around 14$. It's quite pricey considering that the fries weren't good and the drink was just a canned drink. Next time, I'll just get the wrap alone."
/user_details?userid=BjeyTXxk61rAdWyHiLHg9w,Sehrish N.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is small restaurant made more for takeout then dinning in. They do have tables in the restaurant but it's always packed. It is right by Atwater metro/mall. I love coming here for some halal Greek styled food!We were a large group and we ordered the classic and spicy chicken. We were all able to finish our food completely. They do have sides we had fries. They serve canned drinks and water in a pitcher. They don't come serve you food, you pick up your plate from the counter and find a place to sit. We all loved the chicken. It is very oily, so it can get messy. They serve sandwiches as well and a separate take out menu."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This was my first time here. My parents had previously raved about this place and then about a month ago my dad had mentioned that the last time they went, it had gone downhill. I decided to try it for myself.I ordered a chicken pita with fries and an extra Ceasar salad on the side. Right away, there was an issue with the owner's credit card terminal. He insisted that I tap my card, but refused to turn the terminal towards me so I could see the amount. He said that he doesn't make mistakes and that I should trust him. So far, good times!About 5 minutes later, the cook placed my food on the counter. Unfortunately, despite being famished, this meal was nearly inedible;Ceasar salad: drenched in a mass produced store bought dressing that tastes like what you would get at a Super C. If you are going to ruin a salad like this, just take the thing off the menu. It's pure laziness to serve this when you could easily make a batch of homemade dressing once a week.Chicken Pita and fries: The tzatziki sauce was quite good which saves this review from getting one star. The chicken was barely warm. It seems like they had precooked it earlier in the day. There's no other explanation for it not being piping hot. The pita was thin and coated in so much salted seasoning that it completely overpowered the sandwich. The same goes for the fries that were overly salted to the point of hurting my tongue. They were also not very warm and slightly soggy.What a letdown!"

That's it. I don't need salad or fries.I live 5 mins away so the chicken is still warm and the spice and the juice in that chicken.... VERY flavorful and VERY moist! Beyond 5 stars (I'm not endorsed but I wish that I was (with their chicken))Also, the guys behind the counter are really friendly and fun to talk to."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A no-nonsense business that serves great food. Owner(?) was fun to chat with.It's located right outside of the Atwater mall, so its a nice alternative to the shopping center's rather boring food court. Great place if you like marinated grilled chicken and delicious gyros. Fries are nothing special - they're more fillers than anything else. Prices are moderate, and portion sizes are ok."
/user_details?userid=gZh8x3tYWWvCg4ekMPd6IQ,Christine D.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"The chicken was so moist, it just falls off. Just that one sentence took me back to my first bite. Instadrool Lol I mean, look at the photo I posted, isn't it just fucken beautiful? Greek salad with feta cheese was also a hit. And the fries? Let's just say all 3 goes in perfect harmony. Although by the time I finished my plate, my stomach was swimming in olive oil, a little too much for my liking. This is great to have once in a while. Definitely coming back to try their wrap, maybe easier on the oil?"

Warm cosy interior with genuine staff, the owner is a lovely humble and friendly guy.I had the spicy chicken souvlaki which was absolutely perfect and my husband had the half chicken, also very well seasoned. Love the tzatziki, the pita bread, salad ... Everything! This place is simple but huge hearty portions, you are sure to feel sleepy after a meal at Sparta's!!

/user_details?userid=1ViT_LzrNbbrheWgIvT5Tw,Wes N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I really (really really) like this place :DAtmosphere: no frills, no thrills, but definitely no chills - place is clean, tidy and spacious.  The booths are a little small (barely fitting one person per bench) - but you're here for the food (see below) not the accommodations I promise you!  Very much help yourself type of style - don't forget to grab a pitcher of water from the fridge before you sit down!Service: 5 starts and then some! John the owner is down to earth guy and extremely friendly - doesn't seem to take himself too seriously, casually throwing in ""brother"" 2-3 times in a sentence a al Hulk Hogan :D  Always curious and patient - I've never had a bad encounter yet.  Top marks to him as the face of Sparta.Food: Not sure what it is about grilled chicken - but this is another place that gets top marks in my book and deservedly so.  You have to try the souvlaki here - the bread that's used is to die for.  Covered in rosemary herbs and piping hot - it's a generous meal in and of itself.  Spicy or Regular - I go for spicy but both are great!  One can order the half-chicken (for in house consumption) or the whole-chicken (for take out or delivery).  The meat falls off the bone! Grilled and partly baked to lock in the flavour - this is chicken done the Greek way and it's done so very well.  Affordable and simple - it's a meal you won't regret and will come back for again and again!THIS IS SPARTA! :D"

The owner was super nice and helpful and the service was really fast. However the bathrooms were not clean and thats a bummer.
/user_details?userid=kn5Ep0DZTtGp1dpf3NLOKQ,Rg R.,"Montréal-Ouest, Canada",2 star rating,"Ordered a whole chicken with a side of fries and tzatziki. The chicken was very overcooked; charred to the point where the coating was black, and the chicken was tough, dry, and hard to eat. The fries were bland and something that you would get at the frozen section of your grocery store, nothing special there. The tzatziki was plain and tasted more like plain yogurt than tzatziki. It definitely does not live up to its hype, you're better off going to McDonald's or anywhere else in the Alexis Nihon food court."
/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,Karen H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Love love Sparta. I'm a chicken whore so I visit this place often! Spicy chicken is what I order all the time which is hard to find among other restaurants! Everything is delish from here. They deliver also!

/user_details?userid=WY3T5igXM7fpG0QUnSbOdw,Sohana H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,HALAL!This place is Montreal's secret. Delicious and flavorful Greek chicken. I had the spicy chicken souvlaki which was bursting in flavor. I also enjoyed the fries that came with it though it was  nothing special. It reminded me of McDonald fries. The chicken however is something special. So good! The greek salad and pita was also delicious and fresh. SO glad I came upon this place in Montreal. The owner was super friendly and rumor is there opening up a location in Toronto soon! *crosses finger*Price was average and the atmosphere was cozy. 4 Stars because of the fries. Huge portions though.Definitely miss this place!

/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"In all honesty one of the best roasted/grilled/seasoned chicken legs of all my time. I have wanted to try this place many times, but our timing never jived. This was an in-between meal so thus just the one chicken leg, but was just what I needed.Lemon juice, oil and oregano on top, made the chicken skin irresistible. What a mess I left, so thankfully they had a basket of wet wipe packets - I used two and three napkins.I must go back to try the other Greek dishes and get more of that moist savory bird."

It seems a little more expensive because of you'd think they'd leave your plate half-empty like the rest of the food stores near them. No-uh, fill that plate until the fries almost fall off.Amazingly friendly staff. They speak French, English, Persian, Greek and Romanian as far as I could tell. Joking and loving. It almost felt like going to a family reunion with only the cool ones.I fully recommend this place. Divine juicy chicken with nice tasting fries."

/user_details?userid=RowxQgaC5cpOXNDXX3snjw,Anis K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"If I could rate Sparta six stars, wallahi I would, Habibi.As you walk in, you're greeted by their friendly staff, and in my case the owner was very grateful that I brought my friends. ""Thanks for coming brother! ""It's the sort of warm welcome that keeps you coming back.Now, the chicken. In a market that's getting flooded with very similar and overrated Portugueseries, Sparta marches into battle to the beat of their own drum. They bring Greek BBQ Chicken to the Halal scene in Montreal with a flourish. Seasoned to perfection with salt, oregano and their secret spicy sauce, Sparta really manages to differentiate themselves with just the right level of spice and flavour. The natural taste of of the grilled chicken shines through through and baby, it's the business.Split half a chicken between two of you or have an entire one to yourself if you're well hungry, but do try it, habibis.Our conclusion: there are few better options for Iftar this Ramadan. A++, would eat again."
/user_details?userid=1hJQYk3NiajdYK58TQi9EQ,Anita H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great fast food and portions.  It's definitely casual dining with the plastic trays and paper plates but it delivers on the flavour especially the succulent chicken.  I see people ordering a half chicken and just devouring it completely. I suggested this place to my parents and we went together as a family of five to eat and all were happy and satisfied. We probably should've tried to group our orders together in the sense of getting a bigger portion and splitting it between each other. We ordered the large traditional Greek salad which was a great side dish to complement the chicken and fries.  Speaking of the fries, they sprinkle a bit of seasoning on it that make them irresistible! I would also consider going to get the food for takeout to enjoy at home as well."

/user_details?userid=UAGU4JW7MwbpT3kdvbI9jA,Alexander P.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Very sad that I have to give such an awful review to one of my formerly favourite spots for rotisserie chicken. I regularly order delivery from Sparta and am (was...) a regular patron at the restaurant. The last time I ordered delivery, my order did not arrive for more than 2 hours. This would not normally be a deal breaker but instead of receiving an apology for the stone cold food, I was confronted by a hostile driver who seemed offended that I expressed disappointment in the service. Naturally, I was not inclined to give a tip for such rude service despite having tipped generously on all of my other orders. After this encounter I was told -after recently calling for delivery- that they will no longer deliver to my address. Apparently, this is some sort of retribution for not giving them a tip on a single delivery. Very unprofessional and very bad for business."

Like a brave ancient greek soldier i get ready and rush on to St Catherine street to meet my dear Br. Yahya ! Anytime of the day their chickens are minutes away from beeing ready ! The menu is very straight forward, no dilemmas when youre ordering it all depends on how hungry you are, which pieces of chicken you want and if you want it spicy and if you want some pita bread, their chicken souvlaki are very good and offered either as a plate or in a sandwich, their fries dipped into their secret sauce that is hidden in a franks hot sauce bottle is so yummmy in my tummy ! The owner will praise and thank you from the moment you enter the restaurant until you leave ! He is a genuine man with good values and high level of respect for all his customers ! The interior is warm and welcoming, the exposed-brique wall and the great grill smoked across the restaurant makes you just want to sit there after you are done your meal ! The portions are very very generous ! One order is served on 2 plates ;) take out or dine in you wont go wrong either way !"

Very typical souvlaki and the fries were tasty but not really anything to go back for. I saw a few people eating the chicken and it looked pretty tempting, I may go back to try it if I am in the neighbourhood.  It's pretty decent considering I had very little time to eat and I didn't want to eat McDonalds or sacwich however, I would not go out of my way to eat here."

The place was about as busy as you'd expect a place to be at 2 in the afternoon, but I wasn't the only one there.Inside it was like just about any other hole in the wall, paper plates and everything. Order your food at the counter, and grab a drink from the fridge while it's prepared right in front of you. The staff was friendly, chatting with me a bit while the food was being prepared. They seemed to want to know about me and where I came from. There was Greek music playing in the background, which I thought was a nice touch, give the general lack of decoration.The chicken was great, which is all the really matters. Covered in herbs and spices and grilled to perfection. I also had fries with it, but they were not particularly great. Almost your typical fast food fries, except they were seasoned.

/user_details?userid=BwpuHkxY-1yzVTteP-AXPQ,Conner M.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"This place has recently revamped themselves a little bit; they've lowered prices and switched from having waitstaff to ordering at the counter. This means paper plates and plasticware instead of silverwear and ceramic plates, if that makes a difference to you.All in all, Sparta's now a really good bargain. You can get a souvlaki pita for $5 or a trio for $7, which is comparable to anything at the mall across the street, but the quality is much higher. Whole chickens to take out were at about $12, and two for $22. At those prices, my husband and I joked about showing up at parties with twho whole chickens instead of a bag of chips.The chicken is seasoned nicely and grilled, and the flavor is just great. The sauce on the pita is nice and garlicky and the pita is soft. The whole thing has lots of a peppery greek sprinkle on it, which helps to take things to the next level. I believe they also give a discount for students, so that's a good thing if"
