/user_details?userid=4Ebs_E9ANhInJ9YzNXCZvA,Yoko H.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,Definitely one of the places I miss most about the JTM neighborhood! My favorite is the beef lemongrass with a Vietnamese iced coffee. I keep meaning to try their bun buh wei because all the Vietnamese people seem to go their to have their noodles. Their sticky rice is also very good.It's also a great snack to bring to the movie theaters :P (especially if someone is blocking your view).
/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,On the quest for the best banh mi in montreal. This place was pretty good. Bread was better and Much fresher than other places I've been to but I still find they can add more stuffing in the sandwich- why are they always so skimpy ?They definitely have better sauces and their house mayo is great. I also tried the beef soup and enjoyed it - nice taste and spice. Their Iced milk coffee was delicious and would go back for this. I tried the rice cakes with porc and mushroom because I like to try different things but I didn't particularly enjoy this.
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I love Banh Mi sandwiches and I was recommended this place which is conveniently located at the corner of Jean-Talon / St-Denis. Prices have gone up over the years, now the sandwiches are well over $6. The bread is perfect every time, ingredients are fresh and generous. Just make sure to pay attention during the preparation so they don't screw-up your order. Asked for NO SPICY, I GET SUPER SPICY. Not a fun experience when you eat your sandwich well after you left their shop. When they do get it right, it's a solid option."

/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"Updating this because it's been years and I'm vegetarian now and the banh mi here keep us fed and healthy and happy and wise. They are affordable, fresh and fluffy and crazy delicious. The tofu mushroom is filling and juicy and the fresh pickled veg are so good I want to put them on everything. And they sell them here in mason jars so I can! I also like be the smiling friendly helpful staff here, and the iced Vietnamese coffee is everything good in the world in a cup."
/user_details?userid=CxDOIDnH8gp9KXzpBHJYXw,Jennifer K.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,We stopped by Marche Hung Phat to try out their Banh Mi after visiting Jean-Talon Market. There is always room for good food!There was a short line but it moved quite fast. Everyone was ordering Banh Mi to go and so did we! For $4 a nice Vietnamese sandwich is a good deal. The thing I enjoyed the most was the bun with crusty exterior and soft and moist interior.Love the pickled carrot and daikon toppings. Extra Thai chili please!I am not sure if Marche Hung Phat serves the best Banh Mi in Montreal but I can tell you that the one I had was excellent.Skip the Vietnamese Cold Coffee though.. it was meh....
/user_details?userid=5m-Vrz3Y5bfMktZwpJpM2A,Michelle O.,"Jersey City, NJ",4 star rating,"My family and I were looking for asian food for lunch after shopping around in Marche Jean-Talon. It is a vietnamese supermarket/fast food place. Lines can get long but the servers are quick. Seating is limited - probably only seats 10.This place has great bahn mi. It was the probably the best i've ever had. The star of the sandwich is the baguette - it has a crunchy crust with soft filing. They also sell prepared, refrigerated food that you can buy to-go."
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",5 star rating,"By far the best place to come for Banh mi that I've found in Montreal. $4 for a delicious flavourful sandwich of crunchy fresh baguette and contrasting yet crazy delicious flavour. If you haven't had a Vietnamese sandwich you need to get your butt down here to try one. Stop eating subway or smoked meat.... Vietnamese subs are 10X better. I've come here twice in the last few weeks and my mouth is seriously salivating for more. Both my orders were for a B2. Get one....it's loaded with meat, veggies spicy small green peppers win mayo and Vietnamese pate and bacon. It's like an explosion of flavour in your mouth that is crunchy and delicious. The best way I can describe it is a loaded sandwich one of the best in Montreal hands down. If Banh mi is your deal you need to come here to load up your fridge. Great stuff folks. Only the best!"
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I first came here when it first opened a few years back. I am rarely in this area and due to traffic and parking issues, I don't come here often. I forgot how good it is here. This is now my new all-time favourite banh mi place. I got the classic meat banh mi, the shredded pork banh mi, the nem banh mi and the meatball banh mi. It was all excellent!!! The best 16$ invested this week lol! It is so good that I would gladly take on traffic and parking problems! This place also offers other vietnamese dishes, desserts and drinks along with the infamous vietnamese iced coffee. Only 4$ for a 10"" sandwich and if you buy 10 at once, you get the 11th free. The service is great, fast and more than reasonably priced."
/user_details?userid=sKVpHfhkG_Nvgf_Vfb91Cg,Janine T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The Vietnamese tofu bành mì is a vegetarian's dream sandwich and will only set you back 4$!! The bun is perfection, it requires some work but you're not going to break your teeth. The tofu is done just right and the veggies are perfection. I can barely finish one, but I always give it my best effort as it's so damn good. Their Vietnamese coffee is also delicious with the sweet condensed milk, just be very clear with them if you want the hot version as they tend to just give you the iced one automatically. Counter service may look like it'll take forever, so don't be scared if the queue is huge, it goes really fast!"
/user_details?userid=RmxuIIpYDy0AI_Mch4VqjQ,Cherpumple F.,"Baltimore, MD",4 star rating,"After strolling around Jean Talon market, I came here for lunch. More than ten people came in and out and got bahn mi sandwiches, but I got the crab seafood soup.The sandwiches looked legit from the bread to the interior design. So many happy looking people came and went with their bags of sandwiches. The soup takes a while to come out, but it's worth the wait. The crab seafood soup was spicy and they give you the adding aka sprouts, mint, lime. You can ask for Thai basil if you want.Cheap, delicious, thanks to Yelp I had a delicious lunch."

It is always full of people eating at lunch time, the sandwiches are made in front of you, the fridges are stocked with different plates as well. I won't lie, I'm on the verge of going to get one now....."
/user_details?userid=PipGc4TdxurGizJ6CKmU7Q,Daniel B.,"Ann Arbor, MI",4 star rating,"Food should be eaten when it's fresh. That means most pizza's should be enjoyed at the shop, take out Chinese should be the exception rather than the rule, and restaurant meals should be completed at the table whenever possible.Banh mi actually travel quite well, especially when packed properly. This place separates the vegetables from the meat, so that when you reheat the sandwich in the oven (350 F - for 10 to 15 minutes) they don't wilt.The thing is that I live hundreds of miles away, so when my delivery of sandwiches came, they needed a bit of TLC to be brought back to life. If the decision is between fresh banh mi from upstate New York, or a slightly aged sandwich from Marche Hung Phat, I'm going with the imported sandwich every time.What a delicious treat. I had the number one with ham, cha lua, and pate. But this has everything going on. Let me see if I can capture it. Crispy crust, tender crumb, meaty ham, funky pate, creamy dressing, crunchy cucumber, sweet pickles, hot pepper, warm bread, cool veggies, and all of it was in a gloriously harmonious balance. To really get a true sense of the place, I have to get up to Montreal and try several of their freshly made sandwiches. But I'm such a fan, that I could not resist the chance to weigh in on their banh mi excellence. Thanks to all of you who bring me delicious things from all over the world. I'm very lucky indeed."
/user_details?userid=k3El-Q2HwaYF4DHoS9fDIA,Emmaly99 V.,"Flushing, NY",5 star rating,I think we just stumbled to a Vietnamese area of Montreal.  We had to try a banh mi.  It looks like they make their own bread and the sandwiches tastes just like the ones I had in Vietnam.  It's good.
/user_details?userid=vDKJJVVwV-cuFz69jYEB1Q,Diana M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"My only complaint is the little amount of meat in the sandwiches. Of course I get that everyone wants to have extra of everything and not pay anything but they've drastically reduced the meat portions in their sandwich and I feel gypped out. Overall, I still get my sandwiches from here for convenience and taste. I just hope they're not abusing their high rating and reducing where they can to increase profit"
/user_details?userid=A5AlyCR_9BNAtjqWs5TmNw,Gabriella P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,This place has the best Banh Mi's! It's a small little market but has some of the best food and coffee. The staff are very nice aswell.
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Okay, it may seem odd that my review seems less generous than the others, but it's for good reason. When I first walked in, it seemed like a nice, clean, and pretty hopping establishment. The interior was clean, and it drew a mostly Asian crowd, which is a good indicator of nicely-made food. I ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee with a banh mi containing pate, Vietnamese bacon, and other Vietnamese-style cold cuts. Everything was very cheap and the total came to under $10, making this a very economical choice for people looking to eat under a budget. The coffee had a nice balance of strong flavors mixed with a milky undertone and icy coolness, and the banh mi was one of the best I've ever had. The creaminess of the pate combined with the variety of meats, the crunchiness of the vegetables, and spiciness of the peppers (and by spicy, I mean pretty spicy) made for an overall divine sandwich. It should have ideally been a great meal. So where is the problem, exactly?Well, a few hours after consuming all of this goodness, I started feeling quite nauseous and couldn't put my finger on where it came from. It lasted for the better part of a few hours and it wouldn't seem to go up. I hadn't eaten anything else that day, and I was wondering if the banh mi had anything to do with it. It sounds bizarre, especially given how the inside didn't seem dirty at all and the fact that I've eaten banh mi countless times before. Until I try this place again, however, that's the only part I can put my finger on clearly. Hopefully next time I have a better experience."
/user_details?userid=H_09-Wr5JcN5hpp5RnSLTA,Vi L.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"Shout out to my peeps in Montreal for making the Vietnamese everywhere real proud of their superb execution of essential Vietnamese dishes. It's a small little store with to-go plates of sweet and savory favorites, as well as popular noodle soups. They also have a banh mi bar where you can build your own banh mi. The bread was so buttery and crispy, although kind of stingy on the meat. I'm glad I stopped by and had a taste of home in the far North. Highly recommended by a Vietnamese! Also check out the grocery store next door!"

/user_details?userid=MHxV6zAJ5A9AeFXUk5eQtA,Joy O.,"Halifax, Canada",5 star rating,I fell in love with their Bahn Mi after the first bite! Whatever that secret sauce/ mayo they put on their baguette is delicious. It kept the sandwich moist. The baguette itself is a generous size. I didn't feel they were trying to skimp on their meat. Then on top of that they stuffed it with all the veggies and Vietnamese pickles. Heavenly.

When I first tried it, I was a little bit disappointed by the beef sandwich. However, that happens to any place with plenty of variety: you like some and you hate some. I came back for the original sandwich, and it was like the one I ate all my childhood. Really good. It's also very cheap, going for 3,50$ each. They also do it in front of you, all customized and very fast service."
