/user_details?userid=8DzhYRjS6w8MWLjFjPfEQQ,Olivia Y.,"Henrico, VA",5 star rating,"Great food and service! Several members of our party have food allergies (gluten, onions, garlic, peppers) and we though we'd never find a French restaurant in Montreal that would accommodate us, and we were happily proved wrong! They have gluten-free bread and multiple choices on the menu that were celiac-friendly. We had smoked salmon with truffle oil, capers, and fennel and a salad as an appetizer. Both duck dishes (confit duck leg and the maple-glazed duck breast) and the grilled salmon were gluten-free, cooked and seasoned perfectly. They were served with seasonal vegetables, lightly grilled and steamed. The location of the restaurant is perfect if you want to spend the day walking around Old Montreal and go to dinner nearby. However, the entrance is a little difficult to see, you have to enter through the main hotel entrance and then turn right to go into the restaurant. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and has some thematic Napoleon art (we were seated near a painting of The Coronation of Napoleon). All the staff we encountered were friendly and courteous, which made ordering with food allergies very easy.Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant, be sure to get a reservation ahead of time to secure a table!"

/user_details?userid=7zkmP0Eav9LnkgjASOVmLw,Abe K.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"Amazing service. Great food, for the most part. Also, coming from DC, the food prices weren't bad at all for the high class food. The smoked salmon was a bit too salty but still enjoyable. The beef tartare was delicious but my fiancee was bothered by how the serving plating looked too similar to a burger patty. It also should be listed as an appetizer instead of an entree. It was good but after a few bites, it just gets boring. Meanwhile, the snail tartine was flavorful and delicious with a great proportion of flaky puff pastry and chunks of snail. Lastly, the duck breast was perfectly cooked, both tender and packed with flavor. There was an array of vegetables on the plate from carrots, potatoes, green beans, and peas which all gave various delicious crunches."

A sumptuous atmosphere, coupled with French flair and delicious cuisine make for a standout night to remember. My husband and I both ordered the tasting menu, and we were not disappointed. It started off with a lobster bisque soup, homemade smoked salmon, shrimp and scallops, a pallet cleansing sorbet infused with Prosecco, steak and desert medley/coffee. It was a decadent feast for the senses. Dishes are so elegantly presented. For instance, the smoked salmon is presented as a flower!Restaurant is housed in the beautiful, ornate Bonaparte Hotel in Old Montreal. Be prepared to be wowed."

The service is good but I totally didn't get the food. The lobster soup and ravioli are really delicious, then nothing special. The duck breast is just average and the foie gras, I don't know why many people recommend it - it's too greasy for me. The cocktail Le Manhattan i think is not suitable for girls since it's too strong.And what impressed me is that I don't why their desserts are bitter, including the caramel pudding and the three mousses.ThusI'd suggest order separately rather than take the tasting menu."

Dessert is ordinary.Pic2: lobster soup, foie Gras creme brulee, mushroom ravioli, sorbet ,fillet mignon , dessert The best is foie gras creme brulee and fillet mignon.It's a very busy restaurant.

/user_details?userid=V84VOZ3LUNBPh8RdzCLdVg,Grace L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Lovely classy serene spot in old Montreal with quality food. I needed a break after walking all morning and wanted something light ... and a glass of Prosecco. They have a two course lunch menu with a choice of appetizer and price based on what kind of main you get. I wasn't hungry enough so just got a salad and shrimp/scallop appetizer. The food was great! I can taste the butter yum. Servers were very attentive and the ambiance was what I needed :).

The second you take a bite the flavors work their way up to a powerful but not overwhelming peak...then you're left begging for more.
/user_details?userid=M90aCs0T0ZkWnXSpJZHpbw,Hsin-Yi W.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,We had 5 courses menu with price $86 and we all felt really worthy to try! Everything is amazingly good except desert. The lobster bisque and duck foie gras creme brûlée are our favorites. Our entrees were tasty with reasonable portion especially our beef filet mignon was juicy cooked in medium rare. Only complaint was the dessert it was not delicate at all and didn't match all the courses we had before it.
/user_details?userid=JkXjnHgE7wt_0Z0UX1egsQ,Myles C.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",4 star rating,"I generally do not have the opportunity to eat a lot of French food so I do not really have a benchmark restaurant to compare this one too, but for the most part, I found the food enjoyable and the service excellent.The waiters and waitresses do speak English although there is a bit of an accent (This is a French speaking province after all).  Nevertheless, they provided great service and were very attentive and patient with my fruitless efforts to pronounce French foods.  For my more gluttonous Americans, the stigma about French food being a big plate with small portions does hold true, but they give you unlimited bread to satisfy your cravings.The food is tasty! My family and I split the Duck Foie Gras with Creme Brulee (which is like a pâté) which was delicious.  Rich and filled with flavor.  The pear and gingerbread seemed like an odd combination at first, but it worked really well.I ordered the duck confit, but I got to try other dishes as well so I will give a few words about those as well.Duck Confit- The skin was buttery and rich, the meat was tender and well flavored, and all the vegetables were cooked beautifully. Duck Breast- This is the first time I've had duck breast and it was a bit too chewy and tough for my liking.  The flavor was decent at first, but by the time you are done chewing its mostly bland.Veal- The veal is very tender and has a great bite to it, but it needs salt and seasoning.Steak Tartare- The steak tartare tasted incredibly fresh.  It has a nice citrus flavoring which contrasts nicely with the heaviness of the fries.  Overall a good restaurant!"
/user_details?userid=pQVxah1wtzR2U2munUTdtA,Mandy Z.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Located in the old port of Montreal, Restaurant Bonaparte is one of the best French cuisine rated by yelpers. The environment is very French inspired, and the waiter is very attentive and polite. The waiter introduced both tasting menu, one is 4 courses menu and then other is 7 courses menu. I pick the 7 courses menu including the Souffle dessert. With the price of $86, I believe it is a very good deal because it is way cheaper than Toronto. I start with Lobster Bisque, then smoke salmon appetizer, coming to the third course is the shrimp and scallop with vanilla sauce, then I have the pear sorbet to clean my mouth, the main course is the duck breast, and finally finished with chocolate chip Souffle with tea or coffee or hot lemon water.  I did ordered another seafood and fish linguine, and it is not than enough for 2 of us. All the courses are great, but the most memorable one that stand out is the duck breast, the sauce is so tasty and the duck is so tender. I did tell the waiter that it is the best duck breast I ever had, much better than the ones in Toronto. The only thing is the seafood and fish linguine lacks a bit sauce and flavor. I would definitely recommend anyone at Montreal should have dinner at least once in this restaurant."
/user_details?userid=opPpHVIp8SKHMJg3_y5Lew,Mike C.,"Vallejo, CA",5 star rating,"Came here a second time because I loved their mushroom ravioli the first time around.Same quality, and pretty much almost the same menu. You have several options in each course, so if you're craving one type of meat/vegetable over the other, than you can choose that and not be restrained to a typical fixed menu.Wine list is great, and their sommelier can give their best recommendation.Dressy atmosphere, and you can do reservations, but I'm pretty sure you can walk in as well.Very nice date place."
/user_details?userid=5QI6LaC10jM3QyLkvNzpaQ,Elle L.,"Clarksville, MD",5 star rating,"My family and I wanted to experience a French fine dining meal at least once on our trip to Montreal. After sifting through numerous reviews, we selected Bonaparte. We don't regret it at all.The service here is amazing! The servers are very friendly and efficient. They make you feel welcome and always check to see if you have enough water or if you enjoy the food. The service is kind of slow, but that's to be expected at a restaurant such as this, since they make everything to order. The portions are fairly large, and the food is delicious. Everything we tried had so much flavor. We ordered two appetizers-- the onion soup and the escargot. The escargot was plated beautifully and tasted excellent. The onion soup came with cheese bread, which had a sharp flavor and picked up the soup wonderfully. For entrées, my family got the salmon and the scallops, both of which came with various vegetables and were well received. I ordered the filet mignon, and it was the best I'd ever had. The sauce was plentiful and rich, the peppercorn adding a nice kick. The meat was juicy and tender. And the fries were crisp and soft, though I wish they'd been seasoned more.We were too full for dessert, but the menu was extensive, and we saw other tables that seemed to have enjoyed the treats.Overall, we had an outstanding experience! If you're looking for a more formal dinner with friends/family in Montreal that's on the pricier side but is still justified in its expenses, this is the place for you!"

The restaurant is so French it makes you believe you are sitting in Paris. The limited menu offers something for everyone. It being Good Friday, we sacrificed and chose the lobster stew and Dover sole. However, we did pass on desert, but avoided temptation by refusing to look at the desert menu. We had excellent martinis and a nice bottle of French Chardonnay. The wine list is primarily French, but includes bottles from all major wine producing countries. Service was outstanding and perfectly paced. The only possible improvement would be to add poutine to the menu!"

It was not presented in the same manner as the ""French onion soup"" I have enjoyed at other spots however the broth was  quite flavourful and it did take the chill off.For the main I had the fillet mignon. It was cooked perfectly and the peppercorn sauce was delicious.Finished the meal with the calvados soufflé. Despite its size, it was quite light.Room is very pleasant with a nice fireplace. The service was properly attentive without being overbearing.Price was reasonable considering the quality of the meal."
/user_details?userid=cBdCeXu7FaqpW51VQGqBYA,Ching H.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"Hubba Hubba!!! When I dig into my memory bank and recall Restaurant Bonaparte, two things comes to mind. The Sirloin Steak. Never, Have I Ever, had a sirloin steak cooked to such perfection. Typically sirloin is not my go-to cut of steak but alas, Bonaparte showcases the sirloin like never before. Juicy and tender everything you want in a bite of steak is achieved!! Seasoned to perfection. AND we can not fail to mention the mushroom ravioli, I have a soft spot for pasta, the kind that is fresher than fresh and melts in your mouth. This mushroom ravioli would fool any Italian! Honorable mention goes to the sole which was also executed fantastically, but I'm personally not a huge fish eater.Great food is to be enjoyed at Bonaparte, the service is attentive and a visit during Restaurant Week did not disappoint us! It was a great way to try Bonaparte!"

This place has amazing ratings online so my expectations were really high. The food was good, but not great. Everything lacked a bit of flavor and tasted a bit plain. Nothing was impressive and made me want to go back. On the other hand, the service was impeccable. We were served by friendly and nice staff who make great recommendations. They always have a smile on their face and came by our table a few times to make sure everything was ok. The restaurant itself has a nice quiet ambiance and is clean. It was a nice experience and we got to try a new restaurant. However, I don't think I would go back as it's not the kind of food that makes you suddenly have a craving for."

The restaurant is a different matter.I just came in for the last out of 3 of my daily included breakfasts. I would have come in for all 3 had I known the meal. Waitstaff is professional and quiet. Limited breakfast menu but when my food arrived it was lovely. Excellent presentation, tasty, well plated. Small portions it seemed, but I was quite happy by the end of breakfast. Perfect scrambled eggs in a puff pastry, bacon rashers, toast, and a sausage. Orange juice, coffee, yogurt, fruit salad. A complete breakfast.Enter through the hotel lobby, pleasant bar, small but elegant dining room. Tall ceilings, large windows to the cobblestone street view. Old Montreal and a very cozy, elegant spot.Again: I was just there for breakfast. But I will go back for dinner."

Wonderful menu which appeals to any preference--the Dover Sole and Beef Filet were exceptionally good. My husband swears he hates squash but the squash puree with orange which came with his filet was in his words, 'superb'. Everything we ordered was perfectly seasoned and delicious--its always wonderful to enjoy dishes like soup and cognac sauce which include classic and well-executed stock. We especially appreciated the dessert sampler which was just perfect for the 4 of us to share. Our waiter was personable and had the perfect recommendations. Best Cosmopolitans we've had in years---HIGHLY recommend."

/user_details?userid=BkZNc6o--YKBVEGY5rJhuQ,Tiffany O.,"Carson, CA",4 star rating,"Solid meal, and actually not as pricy as I anticipated.Atmosphere: Fancy, proper, clean. Spacious. I was scared I wasn't dressed fancy enough but people were in there with jeans and bags and everything, so they won't turn you away at least, haha.Food: Ordered a la carte. For starters, got the provencale style tartlet with parsley flavoured snails. Quite delightful! The snails had a good texture, and were heavily flavoured with what almost tasted like pesto. They were complimented by a yummy layer of puff pastry and the small salad-like accompaniment was delicious and tangy and tart. For my main, I ordered the Roasted duck breast flavored with maple syrup and wild berries. It was filling, the meat was tender, and the dish was very, very sweet. My partner ordered the Seafood and dish linguini with lobster sauce, and that was amazing. It looks like a little dish but it is packed with seafood and flavor. For dessert, we ordered the grand marnier souffle. I must admit, this tasted TOO much like gran marnier. If you don't want your dessert to taste like straight up alcohol, don't get this. Service: Quick, friendly, attentive.Overall, good dining experience and would recommend."

Moderately priced for delicious food. My favourite is the foie gras creme brûlée and the mushroom ravioli. I've had each dish at least 3 times already!

We made a reservation here for our first year wedding anniversary dinner. The reviews made the place sound amazing. We got there at 9pm and the waiter seemed a little cold and impatient. Fine. I read that the waiters are French and beautiful, so sure maybe they can be cold. However, I noticed that he was really warm to this other party of older couples. He was joking with them and everything. Then these other tables got brought celebratory candles and cake for their anniversaries from other waiters. We got nothing. Not even a congratulations. And yes I did mention this when booking the reservation that we were celebrating a special occasion. I don't expect restaurants to care or bring us anything or even say anything but it does hurt when other people get something special and we get neglected. We ordered a bottle of wine and I think the waiter was looking down on us because we wanted a full body but then didn't want to shell out 70$ for what he recommended. Oh well. On to the food, it was average. Small portions for the tasting menu. We got soup, smoked salmon, foies gras, scallops, and ravioli for the starters. The scallops and ravioli were delicious. Pear sorbet for palate cleanser before the main dishes. I got the fish which was refreshing and hubby got the duck breast which was good. Both entrees were yummy but nothing memorable. Dessert was some small cakes and creme brulee which was also good but not memorable. Expensive meal - around 250$ for mediocre. While meal ended at 12am. Service was really really slow!"

There aren't too many options that fit that description. Luckily, Bonaparte was able to accommodate our group, and it was a really nice meal. For 42 $CAN, the prix fixe is a great deal. I really liked my meal, though I wouldn't say any of the food really blew me away. I had the terrine, which was nice with the bread at the table, and the monkfish, which had a great lobster-meat texture and rich sauce. I snagged a bite of the meat tortellini, which was nice, and the lamb with pork belly was very decadent and well cooked.A friend had called in birthday desserts for the table, which was a nice touch. In retrospect, though, we realize with our prix fixe, we had already in essence paid for desserts. However, given the a la carte menu prices, we still made out with a bargain. It was nice for our big group to have a table in the corner so we could hear each other pretty well."

A gentleman with very good taste in attire and who possesses fine manners. After being seated an explanation if the dishes is underway. Thorough wine pairing suggestions also follows. The food was absolutely delicious and you're treated like a king/queen. They have their dining etiquette down as a chic restaurant should have. A must try.

My husband and I started with the smoke salmon to share and they were nice enough divide the dish into 2 plates each looking very beautiful. My main was the duck and it was cooked to perfection! My husband had the tenderloin and really enjoyed it too. Their dessert menu is also fantastic and alot cheaper than other restaurants. We tried the Lemon tart and the was yummy. I think this will be a restaurant we will visit every time we are in town. I need to try their souffle and their french onion soup next time. I saw other customers have it and it looked really good. Make sure you come hungry so you can really enjoy their food. Reservations are easy to make by open table which is so convenient and it's in the heart of Old Montreal.

It's an upscale place but still not too pricey as compared to other places. My husband & I ordered the $42 three-course meal and it was great. He got a vegetable soup & I got a mixed greens salad with apple & oatmeal. Totally loved the salad, so fresh & light! His soup was ok too but I preferred the salad. Next, we both got chicken breasts, which the lovely waitress offered to serve with their sage cream sauce instead of the original maple syrup on the menu.

Next course I had the mushroom ravioli, the pasta was so tender it melted in my mouth, perfect. My sister had the snails, garlicky buttery goodness! Next was a pear tarragon sorbet, light delicious and refreshing. For the main course I had the duck with maple syrup and berries, impeccably plated and delicious.

Knowing that the tasting menu can be quite a lot of food, we opted for the table d'hote which was appetizer, entrée, dessert and coffee or tea and a la carte of lobster bisque appetizer and duck breast entree.The lobster bisque was amazing, flavourful and fresh. The venison terrine was outstanding; the pickled vegetables were perfectly complimentary to the savory meat. Duck breast entree was lean and therefore best cooked to medium rare. Very delicious. The lamb shank entree was good, but it wasn't fall off the bone tender, the flavor was alright. The pork belly that came with it was also a bit tougher than I expected although it had good flavor. All the vegetables were delicious and cooked to their own degree of perfection. The lime pie dessert was to die for; great flavor and crust.  Paired with the strong coffee, it was a great way to end the evening. Highly recommended!"

Yes, it looks great and they give a towel to hold the glass, but I would prefer a simple cup.- Tea bag. C'mon guys, you have cotton towels in the restroom, and can't brew tea from normal leafs?That is pretty much everything I can complain about:- Onion soup was unusually tasty. I have tried it couple of times before and couldn't understand what's all the fuss about. Now I've finally ate a soup, not a mix of onions and salty water.- Mushroom ravioli were done right - not oversalted and without any aggressive sauce.- Duck with berries was quite a discovery- Deserts were perfect. I've ordered two :)Service consort the dishes: cloakroom attendant was quick and accurate, waiter recommended great wine to match our ducks, all the courses were served on time."
/user_details?userid=1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA,Calvin S.,"Winnipeg, Canada",4 star rating,"+.5 for serviceThis is the 4th French restaurant I tried in Montreal, and I do think it's the best one, at least out of the 4 I tried. I really like the ambience and setting of this restaurant, given the location in Old Montreal. It really does give the French-style dining feel that's quite common in these kinds of restaurants. There are three types of menus here: A la carte, table d'hote, and the tasting menu. Unlike many reviews here, I actually went with a la carte...not a fan of the whole tasting menu concept, and I do have an okay idea of what to expect for French cuisine.My family ordered the french onion soup, lobster bisque, smoked duck breast, escargots, vanilla flavoured shrimp, rack of lamb, and the veal chop. We finished off with a chocolate chip soufflé and a cheesecake.Where do I start...for the soups, the lobster bisque is definitely strong in the lobster fragrance category. I felt the taste was a bit light, but nothing too terrible about it. The french onion soup isn't the type with baked cheese on top, so do keep that in mind. I'd stick with the lobster bisque next time. Smoked duck breast, escargots, and vanilla flavoured shrimp were all uniquely presented and equally delicious. The rack of lamb was grilled perfectly, while the veal chop was a little bit more rare than what we requested (medium rare vs. medium).The desserts are a must here. Both the cheesecake and soufflé were some of the best I had; I definitely recommend the soufflé at the very least, even if it's a 15 minute wait.Service is excellent, all servers are bilingual. Of course, as common courtesy, do attempt to at least speak a bit of French.Will definitely recommend to my friends!"

You can taste the ginger, tomato and carrots and probably some squash or pumpkin.Then followed by the creme brûlée au foie gras. I want to say that they chef did a horrible pairing with the bread. The cinnamon raisin bread definitely  overpowered and you can't taste the foie gras. I had to spread my foie gras on the table bread and it was much better. The texture was silky and the sugar coat added a nice texture and taste to the foie gras.Took the magret de canard with maple syrup and wild fruit sauce. I have to say that the duck was cooked perfectly...medium rare. However, the sauce was lacking substance...almost not enough flavour.Dessert was a combination of small pieces of cakes and creme brûlée...alright but not mind blowing.I'm really disappointed from this first experience given the good reviews on Yelp!"

/user_details?userid=C6_ViNwMNnLHDbbtCwDZuA,Kat J.,"Jersey City, NJ",4 star rating,"We've spent the weekend in Montreal, and I really wanted to try a well regarded French restaurant while we are here.  I narrowed it down to Bonaparte and Montreal Plaza, we ended up going to the former because we were staying near Old Montreal.  We decided to try the tasting menu as it contained most of the dishes we wanted to try and the price was relatively reasonable for a 6 course menu (CAD 78).  See below for the dishes we tried:Lobster bisque enhanced with Ginger - my guy really liked this dish, I thought it was too creamy, but it was flavorfulSalad of mixed greens with pine nuts and parmesan cheese - I actually loved this dish, as weird as it might sound.  It was a simple salad dish, but I loved the different type of greens and how well they complimented each other.  Also, I appreciate how lightly they dressed the salad, as some places tend to get heavy-handed with the dressing.  It goes to show a delicious tasting dish does not need to be complicated.Duck foie gras crème brulée, sautéed apples - we were mixed on this dish.  I loved it, he didn't.  I am a huge fan of foie gras, and the technique of brulee-ing anything.  Who doesn't love the crackle of caramelized sugar?  I wasn't crazy about the cake-y type of bread that accompanied the dish, but the foie gras went well with the bread basket.Shrimp and scallop harmony flavoured with vanilla - I thought this dish was just ok, it came with two pieces of shrimp and a piece of scallop.  I thought the shrimps were a tad overcooked.Mushroom raviolis perfumed with fresh sage - my favorite dish of the evening.  The sage provided a wonderful flavor that pushed the dish from good to great.  I loved how well the raviolis were cooked and the sauce had the perfect amount of creaminess.Pear and tarragon sorbet - I could eat a whole tub of the sorbet, it was light yet flavorful.  It was definitely a great palate cleanserDuck breast flavoured with maple syrup and wild berries - I thought the duck was well flavored and perfectly medium rare, just like I asked for.  Roasted rack of lamb and port wine 'jus' - I normally love lamb, but was not a big fan of this one.  The flavor was lacking.  I thought it was interesting that they give you the same vegetables for all of the main courses.Homemade Desserts - they had a trio of cakes (chocolate mousse, raspberry and cheesecake), as well as creme brulee.  The only standout was the cheesecake, which was heavenly, if I had room, I would've ordered a whole slice of it.I hate to say it, but the service was lackluster for this caliber of restaurant.  I had to track down the waiter a few times just to refill my water glass, yet he was pretty fast in offering me another glass of wine.  Also, I really wanted coffee with my dessert, but had to track down someone again to inquire about the coffee after I've already finished my dessert.  To be fair, it was a packed dining room the night I was there, but I have a different expectation for a formal sit down place like this one.  Overall, I think it was a great experience, I've enjoyed most of the dishes in the tasting menu, and it was definitely worth it to try it once.  I definitely recommend it if you are in town."

Meat was so tender and juicy, it was melting in my mouth. The dessert (usually my favourite part) was kinda average small pastries some were dry and other very good.

She recommended us some good white wine to go with out tasting menu. It was a 6-course tasting menu. We first started with a lobster bisque. It was pretty good. Then came the foie gras crème brûlée was alright with the easy-to-crumble bread. The third course which were escargots was to die for. The there was an intermission with sorbet. It was very refreshing and good for cleansing your palate for my next entrée which was a medium rare rack of lamb. Omfg, you need to get this! We ended the dinner with another Crème Brûlée and some cheese cake. Overall, it was a great tasting menu.

It was too dark for window shopping but we were able to enjoy the many Christmas decorations and lights that adorned cafes and tourist venues.Bonaparte is a quaint and charming restaurant adjoining an auberge. We were seated by the window, in an intimate room with rough brick walls, a curved archway, and a lovely, decorated tree.As we reviewed the large menu, we took in the street life, including romantic calèche rides that rolled slowly by. While I could not make out the drivers' patter, I would like to imagine tales of adventure and romance. It is Montreal, of course.The restaurant offers several different dining options: à la carte, table d'hôte, and tasting menu. We did not have the energy for the longer tasting menu option and instead went with the à la carte option.We shared the mushroom and sage ravioli. The filling was wrapped in a delicately thin pasta that melted with every bite. It is a wonderful way to start the meal. Other apps on the menu include snails in garlic sauce, shrimps and scallops in a cheese sauce, and foie gras, two ways.As entrée, I enjoyed duck breast roasted medium rare, with vegetables, in a savory maple syrup, berry sauce. So delicious.However, it was the soufflé dessert that earned the most praise at our table. Available with chocolate crumbs, calvados brandy (the chef's favorite), and Grand Marnier, the impossibly light and airy soufflé was a welcomed treat. Note, since it takes a while to prepare, the restaurant recommended that we order it mid-entree - which we did.Service was warm and professional. The server made good recommendations, although I think there isn't a bad meal to be had here. With such an extensive menu, we think that a subsequent visit is definitely in order. With the soufflé, of course."

However, the waitstaff was very attentive - no problem whatsoever!Now on to the food. The $78 tasting menu is a good deal. Go for it!As many have already said, the creme brûlée style foie gras is imaginative. However, like others, I can't understand why they chose to pair it with cake-y bread. It's like a bad VP running mate (think Sarah Palin). Why? Just why?!The mushroom ravioli dish tasted super buttery - not a bad thing in my book. The duck was a little tougher than medium rare calls for, but tasty nonetheless.They went overboard with the dessert. No one needs chocolate cake, raspberry cake, cheese cake, AND creme brûlée all at the same time, however small the portions.

/user_details?userid=pwKjyUKxxDNsx9zGIb6xRA,Barbara W.,"Princeton, NJ",5 star rating,"Excellent experience overall. We ordered à la carte: onion soup and filet mignon for my companion, and goat cheese croustillant and lobster navarin for me. Everything was very good. Beautifully presented vegetable accompaniments: probably my favorite part of the entire meal was the parsnip/sweet potato side, which was beautifully seasoned. Note: the lobster navarin is translated as ""stew,"" but it is not liquid-based. It is a delicious and generous portion of fresh lobster on a bit of pasta, with several small and delicious vegetable accompaniments. I told our server I almost didn't order it because I didn't want ""soupe"" and he said customers were sometimes confused by the word ""stew."" Funny they don't clarify it so more people order it.We quickly found a 1/2 liter wine to share, so we dId not scrutinize the wine list, but it was extensive.We shared the soufflé for dessert. We were too full and were not sure about  the soufflé flavors (calvados, grand marnier, and chocolate chip). I wished for chocolate. But how can you turn down a soufflé when someone else is making it? The chocolate chip was a nice surprise: the pockets of melted chocolate within the plain soufflé were great.A great after-dinner drinks list, we had port and Armagnac. Both very good.The decor is a bit staid. I wouldn't mind more character. But it's quiet and peaceful, so that one can enjoy the meal fully. They put a sparkler on my soufflé for my birthday.There are other places in the neighborhood that are more lively, cheaper, but still with fine food, with a younger crowd, noisier,  and so on. We also like Holder: if you are looking for something like that atmosphere and still really good food you might prefer it to Bonaparte.Above all, the service was excellent. Polite and professional, but also warm and ready to answer questions. None of the snoot  you get in high-end restaurants in, say, NYC. And the staff are clearly invested in their work.If you haven't splurged on a real fancy meal before, this is a good place to start. They'll welcome you and host you with care.Our meal was $260 for two, including one dessert, one 1/2 liter of wine , and two splurgy after-dinner drinks.  A starter and main were more than filling enough."

/user_details?userid=KaxlClKYXWQWrqsA31xs8w,Gabriel A.,"Brooklyn, NY",2 star rating,"This place is simply not worth the price. One of us had the tuna steak from the a la carte menu while the other had the prix fixe menu. The prix fixe was vegetable soup, steak and chocolate mousse. The food just isn't good. The steak is average at best, while the tuna tasted cheap and poorly prepared. The worst part is that both entrees - one prix fixe, the other a la carte, both came with the same exact sides (see images). Grilled vegetables and squash. Where is the creativity? Or even the simple acknowledgement that different entrees (meat vs fish) need different accompaniments? Ultimately feels like lazy, bad food for $45+ without even getting a drink. Cocktails on the menu, while not tried, looked very standard. Why even put an Old Fashioned that follows the basic recipe to a tee on the menu? Again, why pay a premium for basics?The service was the silver lining, which was fantastic. The waitstaff are attentive and hospitable. The decor is nice in the classic restaurant (read: not trendy) sense. Do better, support a harder working chef, get what you pay for. Go elsewhere."

However this year, staying at the hotel, we had several opportunities to stay here.With a nearly empty restaurant at breakfast, it will still take 15 minutes to sit 5 people and 40 minutes to get your breakfast and the server will almost never be around. At dinner, we ordered a bottle of wine, the server broke the cork, and pushed the broken piece down into the bottle. She did not offer to get us a new bottle, instead just poured it for us. We had broken pieces of cork we had to fish out of our wine glasses. For a $500 check, we expected we could at least get a fresh bottle of wine.That being said, the restrooms were exquisite and the kitchen did an absolutely wonderful job.

/user_details?userid=Cbv9M1zL29rjVFFhbGTpiQ,Elizabeth B.,"Maplewood, NJ",3 star rating,"Do not get exiled to the back room! Bonaparte is our once (or twice) a year treat so we were very disappointed with our Christmas Eve dinner, which was not up to the restaurant's usual standards.  We were seated in the back room (8 tables) and service was incredibly slow.  We waited to receive menus, waited for water, waited for our drinks, and after about 30 minutes the waiter finally took our order.  By that time I had almost forgotten what I wanted.  This treatment was not unique to our table.  Every table I could see sat for a long time with their menus closed while the waiter walked past them multiple times.  The family of four next to us also waited about 30 minutes to order, although at least they got bread while they were waiting.  For some reason, the server (assistant waiter?) didn't give us bread until we had ordered (did he think we would eat it and leave?).Thankfully we only ordered the three course meal, because it took as long to arrive as the five course tasting menu.  Please note that I wrote ""arrive"" because it did not take us 3+ hours to eat our food, we were just waiting - often with empty dirty plates in front of us and empty glasses.Overall the food was good, but not what we expect from Bonaparte.  My husband was not happy that his mushroom ravioli were stuck to the plate, probably because the dish had been sitting under the hot lamp in the kitchen for so long.  This supported our theory that the problem was with the service, not with the kitchen.We would have asked for a fresh dish, but the waiter and server were rarely there.  Each would do one task and then leave the room.  We weren't the only frustrated table.  Something was wrong with a dish at the table next to us and he fumed for probably 5 minutes waiting to see someone to complain to.I think the problem was our location.  In the past, I've seen the maître d' take orders, remove empty dishes, etc.  But there was no one walking through our room to see that our waiter and server were unable to do these basic tasks in a reasonable amount of time.Will we go back?  Maybe.  But probably not on a holiday.  And if they try to seat us in the back again, we will wait for a different table."

The escargot was the perfect texture and the contrast of the soft escargot and the phyllo shell was highly enjoyable. The duck was tender and sweet, the tartness of the berries didn't let the maple flavor overpower the dish. As for dessert, although the sampling was quite enjoyable, the creme brûlée was the star, the sugar was caramelized just right, and the custard itself was smooth and creamy, sweet, yet light. It was the best meal ever and I'm so happy we splurged."

/user_details?userid=_6T7LO81WegvdUqzCMvtBQ,Eric M.,"Columbus, OH",5 star rating,"Fantastically French. We went here for our usual ""one really nice dinner while we're here"" and Bonaparte did not disappoint! We scarfed down the bread and butter and our cocktails like disgusting heathens and loved every second of it. Our wait staff was fantastic in both English and French, and having spent some time in France, Bonaparte is, so far, the closest resemblance to a great French Restaurant I've been to since. My only criticism for this restaurant, and this is a common trend, is that the beer selection could be vastly improved for a restaurant of this caliber. Now, as a French restaurant it's all about the wine, and my Graham's desert wine (my favorite) did not disappoint, but it would be nice to see more attention paid to the beer selection just to make sure the restaurant is firing on absolutely all cylinders.If you're a vegetarian, please keep in mind that the menu is quite limited. I don't allow this fact to influence my reviews, as I don't try to impose my diet on others, but this is something to consider (maybe have a snack beforehand). I enjoyed the mushroom ravioli from the starters menu, and then really delved into the soufflé and  crème brûlée. The soufflé was crazy. Make a reservation."

The place does seem like it caters to a more conservative, older crowd, but the menu is varied and everything looked very appetizing.  Right off the bat I noticed they had a snail entrée, I'm a fan! It was absolutely delicious, and the portion size was perfect. They do try to incorporate vegetarian options (well...one option) and it does feel like an afterthought a bit, but since I didn't order it, I can't say too much. Instead I opted for the magret de canard served with a berry sauce and a squash purée and ...honestly I have nothing bad to say. We wanted to finish on a high note and ordered dessert. I liked my lime pie, but I would have liked it more if there was more of it. The Grand Marnier soufflé is not only massive, but very boozy. Very. Boozy. They have a massive - and expensive - sampling menu that I keep in the back of my mind.."

Was told there are no seats, as we didn't have a reservation, however after a second the manager said that he may have a table for us, if we will take it. Expecting something in the crawl space above the attic or under the basement stairs, we were led to a cozy table by the fireplace. If you think this was amazing, then the food was triple amazing, the waiters were very nice and nearly invisible yet always there when you needed them, and happy to provide advice on food pairings and etc. The place is not cheap, but worth every penny.

An adventurous risk with maybe just a dash too much vanilla but delicious nonetheless. The wine is fantastic here but on the pricier end. The food also could have been hotter, not sure who to blame for that. Overall expect to spend about $100 per person with wine for a three course meal. I would say it's worth the money for a special occasion."

/user_details?userid=u4iBXHU_ZCUIXymxkcsHdA,Jessica M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Food: 4/5Service: 4/5Atmosphere: 4.5/5Cleanliness: 4.5/5Price: $$$$The words 'affordable' and 'tasting menu' don't really go together, but I think Restaurant Bonaparte in Old Montréal is one that fits the description! It's one of the highest rated restaurants for French cuisine in the city, and rightfully so. Hubby and I visited the restaurant last year, but I think our tasting menu experience is worth reading because the menu doesn't seem to have changed much on their website.I ordered a glass of white wine to have along with my tasting menu, though I don't remember which one I ordered.A complimentary bread was given also, filled with an assortment baguettes and other French breads. I decided to try their lobster bisque for my first course while my husband decided to try the salad. The soup was delicious, and I would've loved to order it separately on another occasion upon available. Portion sizes were also pretty good, not too small but not so large leaving me with no room for the next course.For our second course, I chose the duck foie gras creme brûlée while my husband chose the smoked salmon dish. Both were equally good, but I thought that my dish was more creative therefore more unique. I love trying unique dishes whenever I try a tasting menu; trying duck foie gras was unique to begin with because usually foie gras is from geese, not duck. To be honest, I couldn't tell a big difference, especially because it was made into a creme brûlée. I guess using duck foie gras kept the price of the tasting menu in check, bringing down the price overall and making it more affordable.Hubby's smoked salmon was great, but he preferred my dish over his. The truffle oil was a nice touch, but if you know truffle, you'd know that there isn't actually any truffle in truffle oil, just the scent. Anyway, it was still good nonetheless, especially with the smoked salmon, but we would prefer to order the duck foie gras creme brûlée over the smoked salmon if you eat foie gras.Our next course was nice, but to be honest not the most memorable. It was good - definitely not bad, but nothing particular really stood out to us in either of the dishes.Our fourth course was a breather, one where our palates were refreshed and reset for the upcoming main course. The sorbet was really light and  delicious! Though I haven't had much tarragon before, the herb was well balanced with the sweetness of the pear.The real highlight of the night was the rack of lamb presented for our fifth and main course. Hubby chose to have the beef filet mignon which was just as good, but the roasted rack of lamb that I had was so much better. The port wine 'jus' was so incredibly delicious! We highly recommend that you order the rack of lamb as well if you like lamb. The gamey smell of lamb is nonexistent and the meat was so tender and juicy. The portions of the lamb weren't too bad for a tasting meal either.To end off our tasting menu and date night, we were served an assortment of desserts for our last course. We were also offered some tea or coffee which we delightedly enjoyed. I always get peppermint tea whenever I can after a large meal which I think helps soothe me and my bloated stomach. The desserts weren't too creative but delicious nonetheless.If you're looking for a place to take your significant other on a romantic dinner, I highly recommend Bonaparte and their tasting menu! Though there are numerous romantic restaurants in Old Montreal, Bonaparte outdone themselves with the quality of their tasting menu while keeping the price tag relatively affordable for a tasting menu. A quick google search of Bonaparte gives you endless 5 star ratings of the restaurant, and for good reason! I would revisit Bonaparte in a heartbeat and order their tasting menu again because I enjoyed it that much."

My friend and I were staying at the hotel and breakfast is included with the room. I have stayed in many hotels that include breakfast and have come to expect free breakfast = mediocre food at best. Not here! To start we each had the fruit cup....which was lovely. Then I had the French toast. Outstanding in every respect. The crusty French bread, the hint of orange (Grand Marnier?), tiny side of whipped cream, real maple syrup, all cooked to perfection. But wait! There's more! As part of the breakfast menu you can opt for a croissant or other bread. I don't remember the other bread options, once they said croissant I was sold. Also in the bread basket are two mini muffins. I did not have the muffin as I was totally full. My friend ate one and she reports the muffin was excellent. Just to round things out, the breakfast includes orange juice and coffee/tea. I hope I have conveyed my appreciation of the food. (So good I ordered the same thing on back-to-back days.). I would also like to mention the setting is lovely. It didn't hurt sitting at the window overlooking the street and quaint older buildings. And finally, the wait staff was truly outstanding. I am sorry not to call out specific people but everyone was great. As I mentioned breakfast was included with the hotel room. However, for walk-ins it is $15.

I would say it was one of the best experience that I've ever had so far. The menu for Mtl a table was 41$. I ordered the veggie soup and the mushrooms raviolis to start off with. They are both amazing especially the raviolis knocked me off. For the main course, I ordered the Magret de canard and my friend Jarret d'agneau. Both medium cooked. They are both amazing, well seasoned, the meat have multiple levels of taste: the lamb was braised in wine  so the fruity flavor of the wine was there, and the duck was crispy outside on the skin with a little fat left in the middle but it doesn't feel greasy as all. For the dessert, I got the lemon pie and my friend the chocolate mousse. The lemon pie was good but compared to the chocolate mousse, the later definitely won. The chocolate mousse was a bit bitter and it matches perfectly with the light mousse texture. I can't help myself but stole the half of it from my friend although we were all really stuffed. Last but not least, the service was impeccable. I was there 20minutes earlier. As I was waiting at the bar area, the waiter offers me the water to drink although I said it was ok to simply wait for my friend to arrive. When my table was ready, the manager pulled out the chair for me. I really felt to be treated like a queen. Our waiter Yannick was super friendly and attentive. The dishes came quickly and he mentioned not to touch the plates as they were very hot when served. As for 41$ plus taxes and tips, it was a worthwhile experience and I am willing to return back to try other dishes. I have paid the same restaurant at Mtl a table at a restaurant for some mediocre dishes, but Bonaparte did a good advertisement for themselves. Good job!

Both were excellent - (5/5)!  The Pear and Tarragon Sorbet with champagne was okay but no spoons were provided - (3/5).  For mains we had the filet mignon and rack of lamb both pink - (4/5).  The desert course was excellent (5/5).  This was followed by coffee or tea.  The bottom line is the atmosphere was excellent (5/5).  Presentation was excellent (5/5).  Food taste was good (4/5).  Food value was average (3/5).  Service was poor (2/5).  In conclusion I think this place is a bit touristy and you can get a better bang for your buck elsewhere."

The restaurant was pretty much booked out. The waiters were nice, but they were very busy so they could not really serve us as soon as we called them. I chose the lobster bisque and smoked salmon, and they were both very good. Especially the bisque, it was very delicate. I ordered beef filet mignon for my main. It was not as good as I had expected. It was average, compared to the bisque and the smoked salmon. My friends ordered duck and they thought it was average too. The final dessert was very good. We had three kinds of small cakes and a creme brûlée. By the way, they served lots of bread....lol."

After half my order was messed up and after the manager comping my meal, it still does not justify the disappointment and the ability for them to ruin my wife's birthday. This place messed up big time and I would never recommend them to anyone. My preset tasting menu turned out to be such a huge failure, you guys really need to get it together.

We both got the table d'hôte. I think the only thing that we didn't like was we felt the main course which we both got beef in red wine sauce was a little under seasoned.

I was expecting the portion sizes to be smaller but they actually were decent. I also ordered a dessert which was essentially samples of multiple desserts. All were great! The chocolate fudge cake and cheesecake might've been the top 2 but even the sorbets were very tasty. My only critique was that the beer menu was very small and that some of the workers seemed a bit smug. But enjoyed Bonaparte very much. Would absolutely recommend and return if visiting Montreal."

Parking was a bit of an issue as it is in old Montreal, but there is an unloading zone in front of the hotel and then parking is an additional $30 at a lot across the street. The included breakfast was something dreams are made of. I've never had such a gourmet breakfast that was included with a hotel. White tablecloth service.

From beginning to end, it seemed to get worse. We ordered 3 Table D'Hote meals and one seafood linguine and wine. Portions were a good size, well plated, and flavorful.  I would certainly recommend visiting for the food; we didn't have one bad bite. As for service, they never cleared our bread plates, my husband asked for water refills 3 times after waiting to see if it would be refilled, our food was delivered to the wrong person at the table with every single course-- we had to call that out and wait for someone to go back to the to get a towel to move our entree plates because they were too warm. We were never offered the coffee or tea with dessert (I had to flag someone down to explicitly ask after our dessert was already delivered).  I asked our server which of two wines he would recommend with my meal and he completely did not know. I ended up picking myself based only on the type of wine itself. Our dessert was delivered almost 30 minutes after our last plates were cleared. And this was just the basics and not what we expected for this level of dining (didn't clear crumbs from table, clear the silverware properly with courses, etc.).  A table behind us was left waiting for a long time and were delivered the wrong bottle of wine, which had to be sent back. Our meal took well over 2 hours. I left a tip representative of the service I felt we received, and the server saw and gave us a  complete cold shoulder as we left. Not a single staff member acknowledged us as we left the restaurant.  Great meal, really underwhelming service."

Once we started our meal, we immediately realized knew that the quality & presentation worth such prices.I had soup of the day (red vegetable soup) and a lobster salad. The soup was great, though I would appreciate a tiny tad more of flavor enhancement (maybe some herb?). The lobster salad with hazelnut oil and maple syrup was delicious! Every element on the plate tasted so fresh and harmonious with each other. Nothing is overpowering another. The oil and syrup were lightly but thoroughly applied, leaving no greasy texture but beautiful scent in your mouth. The lobster meat was also nicely poached with nice fresh texture.My husband ordered the 3 courses meal with brushetta, milk-fed calf steak, and chocolate mousse. The brushetta was nicely plated. The milk-fed calf steak was excellent. It was tender and juicy. You can really taste the milky diet when tasting the meat. However my husband would appreciate the intensity of peppercorn sauce was too much and not necessary. It would be perfect if the pepper was reduced.

Sounded like a ringing endorsement.I expected excellent service and got it. I expected delicious food and got that too. What I did not expect -- and was pleasantly surprised by -- was the satisfactory portion sizes. We did not leave hungry.  The soup, the duck, the foie gras, and the deserts were all delicious.I don't know when I'll be back in Montreal, but the Bonaparte will certainly be on my itinerary when I am."

Once we checked in they  had the prix fix menu for the restaurant week. We choose 4 course meal for the night. Myself and hubby ordered the lobster bisque which we loved, the next course was foie gras mousse which we both thought was average, for main course I ordered Sole fish which knocked everything out of the park. The fish was juicy, buttery, flaky and the sides of veggies and mash was just right. Hubby ordered the rack of lamb which was meaty and the sides complimented the meat appropriately. The dessert was a symphony of cakes - cheescake, choclate and orange cake. I enjoyed the dessert very much and would recommend in a heartbeat. The wine choices were fantastic and ordered the Prosecco which was fantastic and complimented well with the fish. The ambiance and service was excellent. It had been a fantastic and memorable night."

Wait time between courses sometimes seemed forever. Although after one lengthy period the wait was redeemed by the best execution of the entire evening. The rack of lamb accompanied by ratatouille was a difficult to dish to execute, requiring multiple cooking techniques and times, but it came out near perfect. Each element seemed to be at the perfect temperature and taste. The mushroom ravioli was a great dish as well. Would like to go back again to better service though."

The food is good especially when it's hard to find good French food these days and if you're talking about price this place is well worth it. The ambience setting is a solid 4.5 out of 5 because the decor is awesome for that formal classic look but yeah the space isn't huge nor is it suppose to be as its situated in a hotel. The food now that's where it gets interesting, when walking the streets of old Montreal I was surprised that the restaurant is like one of its kind local hole in the wall joint. The terrine was flavorful, the braised lamb was definitely rich and dense in taste, yet for escargot I guess this is subjective since I like my escargot in shells on tin plate. But all in all this place was solid so for the place and the food, it's one of a kind. Because of the unique qualite, I give it a five. Au revoir."
/user_details?userid=WujpioG8Szy6Gu4IXlXYwA,Maura H.,"Indianapolis, IN",5 star rating,"I rarely give 5 stars, but this restaurant deserves it! Our hotel concierge recommended Bonaparte for our 10th anniversary dinner, and we are so glad he did! The dining space is classic French elegance. Expect a 2 to 3 hour meal. We had a table for two by the front window-perfectly intimate. We did the tasting menu, approximately $75 Canadian dollars per person, which had 7 courses. Portion sizes were great and the plates were almost too beautiful to eat. Everything we had was wonderful, done in traditional French style. The best part for me personally was that our concierge had informed them of my gluten allergy and they not only catered my whole meal to that, they made gluten free bread for me! I almost cried. We ended the meal with sparklers in our dessert course. A truly wonderful dining experience!"
/user_details?userid=ruvp5bIonK-72pGTsPPhMw,Sam S.,"Las Vegas, NV",3 star rating,"First off, based on other reviews it's possible we had a unique experience at Bonaparte, or just that our server simply did not like us.  It was Christmas Eve and maybe the place was more busy than usual, but everyone included the manager and host seemed to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  That made it a bit difficult to relax and enjoy the ambiance in this beautifully decorated restaurant in the heart of Old Montreal.The goat cheese, ravioli and escargot appetizers were amazing, as was the Onion soup (not too filling!).  The bread was excellent and they kept it coming.  But the service aside from that was continually disappointing. He did not take our drink orders before attempting to get our food orders. He was reluctant to answer questions and seemed distracted and irritated, often not making eye contact and watching other tables while speaking to us. He also walked away before we finished ordering and seemed angry with us when we grabbed him to complete our order! This gentlemen didn't just seem to be busy but rather just seemed to be an unpleasant person. Given the expense of our final bill ($275!) I would expect to be treated at least as nicely as I had been in the basic irish pub we dined in the night before."
/user_details?userid=vnTq4H7r1lw-zEu5WwH3GA,Steve R.,"Manchester, CT",4 star rating,"I have to admit that the reason we stopped in Bonaparte was because the other places we tried beforehand all told us they were reserved for the night.  Bonaparte told us the same, but they had space for us to sit at the bar.The bartender was friendly; I ordered a glass of wine while my coworkers had some beer.  After that I was in for a long wait for my dinner since my coworkers decided to order 5 course meals where I was only interested in an entree.  Each of their appetizers looked amazing but the bread while I waited was tasty.  I ordered the lamb and ratatouille which was absolutely amazing.  Both of my coworkers ordered the same and we all loved it.Overall I'm giving them four stars because the price was a little high, though that is understandable given the location and the atmosphere.  I was also a little unsatisfied with the service.  I had asked for a glass of wine when my dinner came out but the bartender forgot.  When he asked if I still wanted it I said yes but he still didn't bring it.  The food quality here was excellent though.  I would likely come back, but there are so many good restaurants in old Montreal that I would probably try a few others before returning."

/user_details?userid=24fVnx6Aw2byAlBfmyooqQ,William W.,"Topanga, CA",1 star rating,"This place was probably very good at some point. So good in fact that it went to their heads and its been downhill ever since. I've eaten at some rather fantastic French restaurants in Paris, Lyon, Beaune and throughout the South of France in my life, not to mention restaurants in many of the other great cities of the world. None of them had the arrogance in their manner of service and treatment of clients that this place had. I've seen it a few times before to a lesser degree at those pretend French restaurants (the type where the waiters speak with a French accent, but actually can't speak French -- happened to me in Beverly Hills, California) where they try to bluff their way through, and on rare occasion at restaurants that had once been great and had lost it and were left simply to trade on their former reputation. I noticed it the first time we tried to eat at Bonaparte and they sent us away because the kitchen had just closed. Its not that I don't understand the kitchen being closed and thus the inability for them to serve us, but rather it's the manner in which it was done. I noticed it the second time on the amazed face of our concierge when she tried to make a dinner reservation. She was astonished at how they treated her, the concierge of one of Old Montreal's top hotels. And we experienced it in such full force when we arrived for dinner that we had to leave, never having ordered. It was just such an unwelcoming dismissive arrogance that comes from the restaurant staff thinking the customer is not a customer but a mark who should count himself lucky to be in their presence, totally forgetting that actually they are there to welcome, serve, and make us, the customer, feel special. The crowning moment was when the waitress told us how we should not speak French because if we did she would then answer in French and we of course could not understand French. Quelle surprise, given that my family is French and I speak fluent French having lived and gone to school in France, and my wife speaks more than passable French. It just blew us away and was the final straw that popped the bubble of high hopes for dinner at Bonaparte. The sad truth is the motto of this restaurant has become ""Bonaparte, where the customer is always wrong."""
/user_details?userid=f-_HyNO4LKYSygqpsYMKyg,Jen S.,"Chattanooga, TN",5 star rating,"So happy we stayed here. This hotel is in the heart of old Montreal, just steps from Notre Dame Basilica, and was a top notch accommodation. The staff were friendly and very helpful with area information and had maps on the ready to share directions. The room was gorgeous-- hardwood floors with tall ceilings and exposed brick. The bathroom had an enormous whirlpool tub that we didn't have time to use but for a longer stay, a nice soak after a long day of walking would have been awesome. Comfortable beds are a big deal to me and these did not disappoint! Heavy room darkening drapes let us sleep in a tad when we wanted to. Free wifi connection in the hotel. There is a tiny rooftop terrace with some seats, perfect if you wanted to grab a bottle of wine somewhere and take up to enjoy the night air and view. The complimentary breakfast was also above expectation- I had the fruit cup (Apple, grape, mango, strawberry), croissant, and crepes with maple syrup one day and other days the poached egg with sage butter/ potatoes/sausage/bacon. They had many other choices but these were delicious. Comes with good strong coffee and oj.We took the 747 bus from the airport and it was a quick 15 minute walk from the stop to the hotel. (We'd rather spend $10 on a bus ride than $40 plus tip on a taxi and use the savings to get another dessert, beer or glass of wine somewhere - and there are plenty places nearby for that!)Loved this place! Would absolutely stay again!! Only regret is not having time to dine in the restaurant downstairs."

This was worth every penny!We came to Montreal (and Nova Scotia) for our honeymoon and needed a nice place for dinner before a show. On a recommendation from the concierge at out hotel, we chose Restaurant Bonaparte. We made a reservation, even though I'm pretty sure we were the first ones in the door for dinner service. Oh em gee- one of the best meals EVER. I started with the lobster salad (still thinking about it. A SALAD.), we had french bread, a bottle of wine. To drive the point home about the salad, it was a bit of lettuce and some shredded veggies with huge chunks of lobster meat and a hazlenut vinagrette. Seriously, I can still taste it if I close my eyes...For an entree, I had the Scallop Delight- scallops in truffle oil, and Gordon enjoyed the Dover Sole in pine nuts and butter. Delish. Creme brulee and Creme caramel for dessert. We were seated in the window which was a great spot to be in Old Montreal. The service was top notch and the waiter helped me choose a nice wine.A great meal and a highlight of our trip."

Pick their 2013 Pinot Noir French Bourgogne by glass for $15 CAN, 500 mL $45,  or bottle $70. One glass is not enough. Pair it with lamb or pork. It's probably the best value for a semi-mature French Bordeaux on their selection.  Impress your date and order it!"
/user_details?userid=v-cIVu2yAtyBIx5PhnAUaw,Paul S.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Had an amazing meal here with friends on our last night in Montreal. The five of us were there at opening and were quite lucky that another table canceled earlier in the day and we were able to get seats on an otherwise fully booked night. Before even entering, the menu posted outside caught our eye. In our group of five, four of us ordered the tasting menu. One had special gluten-free dietary restrictions and they were happy to alter every dish for her as needed. One was a vegetarian and ordered off the ala carte menu. They were even so kind to bring our friend gluten free bread and a separate butter just for her.The first course on my tasting menu was the lobster bisque. It was smooth and creamy with good lobster flavor. The second course was foie gras creme brulee. This dish was fantastic. The creamy foie gras with the caramelized crispy top served with bread and a bit of apple was a fantastic combination of flavors. Third course was escargot on cripsy filo dough. The escargot was the most tender escargot I have ever had although normally I like a little bit of chew in my escargot. Fourth course was a simple pear sorbet palate cleanser in champagne. Simple but refreshing. I was fully ready for my main course by then. For my fifth and main course, I had the lamb chops. They were cooked to a perfect medium rare and served with a red wine reduction sauce. It was the most tender lamb chops I have ever had. I would go back again just for those lamb chops. The sixth and final course was an array of desserts including creme brulee, cheesecake, chocolate cake, and raspberry jelly cake. All were very good although I was not a big fan of the raspberry jelly cake.The entire tasting menu was also a great value at $78. Coming from New York City, this was a steal. We were all incredibly happy at the end of our meal that we just happened to run into this gem of a restaurant. To top it off, the service was also impeccable and our waitress happily catered to our group's dietary restrictions. I highly recommend this restaurant and would definitely come back again on my next trip to Montreal."

Especially if they serve you the bison steak in that red wine sauce....Mmmmmm That steak alone would make me want to come back to place. It was so tender and juicy and just paired so so well with that red wine sauce. And it was perfectly cooked to the medium rare that I like too! And it is a good thing that the steak was so incredible, because the seafood linguini I got as my first dish was just okay. It was supposed to be in this saffron sauce but I think they must have forgotten the saffron, because it didn't taste like much and that is such a strong flavor normally! But at least the seafood itself in the pasta was pretty tasty. And the chocolate mouse....Wow. I love chocolate. I am close to being an addict I think since whenever I see a dessert menu anything with the word chocolate in it directly grasps my visual attention, so I couldn't pass up this option either! And I am really glad that I didn't! It was so light and rich at the same time and with that mint leaf it was the perfect way to end my meal!The wine here is pricey though...But Montreal in general is pricey, so just be prepared to throw down a bit of money if you come here, but I promise the food is really good! Everyone else in our party loved their food as well! So bring money and don't be in a rush, since they also took a little bit of time getting to our food order heh"

I went with my family for a celebratory dinner when I was back home and I'm thinking about this meal months later. Two of us had the table d'hote, one a la carte, and my sister had the tasting menu (we all got to try her dishes to help her out). Every single dish was prepared as requested, seasoned well, and came at a leisurely, yet not too drawn-out pace. My parents had been here several times before but I had always declined because I assumed it would be stuffy, but the location in the Auberge means that the clientele is of all ages - some clearly younger than myself so I didn't feel out of place. If you love dessert soufflé you should make sure to get it here, it is divine, I only wished that I had ordered it myself and wasn't limited to tasting my dad's! He got the Grand Mariner one, but there is also one flavored with Calvados, or a chocolate chip one if you don't like the taste of alcohol.I'm going to try very hard to visit again when I am back in town next."

Let me state that I've usually eaten in the far room which is more traditional. As I remembered there used to be an amuse-bouche served which we did not receive during this experience. The service used to be elegant and proper taking the diner back to a time when dining out was a formal experience. There used to be a server and captain of the table with nicely dressed staff. During my latest encounter the service was fair, but nothing like it used to be. If I had not dined here previously I never would have known about the soufflés which are definitely a star of the restaurant. The menu leans more towards traditional French which I enjoy. The ingredients are top notch and the preparations are fresh, however in today's dining culture nothing is terribly exciting. The escargot was delicious, neither over-sauced, nor overly spiced or salted with an innovative presentation. My beef au poivre was tender and tasty as was my wife's duck breast. Overall everything was good, however with the regression of service combined with the food being somewhat hackneyed I would definitely try newer establishments with a more contemporary flair before returning for my 5th dining experience at Bonaparte."

They gave us some time to look over the menu and asked if we had any questions. We ordered a half bottle of the riesling and started with the lobster bisque and Duck foie gras crème brulée. Everybody LOVED the duck foie gras and said it was delicious. The lobster bisque was OK. Its not New England lobster bisque (obviously), it tasted more like shrimp soup, but it was still good.For an entree, I had the duck breast. My friends got the duck confit and the rack of lamb. All the entrees were delicious. I was most surprised by the lamb. It was so tender and not gamy. Both duck entrees were really good as well. The duck confit was really flavorful and tender. The meat just fell right off the bone and melted in my mouth.For dessert, we shared the profiterole and a grand marnier souffle. As stated on the menu, these dessert requires 18 minutes to prepare. The profiteroles were amazing. The puffs tasted really fresh and had a slight crunchy layer on the outside. They were filled with very delicious vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate sauce. The souffle was really good as well. I think this is the first time I've had ""real"" souffle. It was really light and fluffy. NomNomNommmm A bit heavy on the grand marnier, but hey, no one's complaining about that.I would definitely recommend this place. Again, the food was excellent,  the service was great.

The cocktail I got was one of the best cocktails I have ever had in my entire life. So that started things off on the right foot! The complementary bread was good, too. I ordered from the table d'hote menu with three courses for $40 Canadian -- I had a basic salad (good,) rockfish (wonderful,) and chocolate mousse (wonderful.) The husband ordered the chicken with brie entree, and he thought it was delicious and that the brie was a very good quality. We also ordered profiteroles, which were amazing! They even brought out our two desserts with sparklers! The service was spectacular. The servers were very kind and appreciative. They regularly refilled our water, answered any questions, etc. Five stars for this place! Would highly recommend and would return if we're ever in Montreal again!!"

The general mood of the place - its dim light, pictures and wood panels / rich colored decor - is relaxed and has a certain timelessness about it. Don't expect very fast service. You're here for an un-rushed time.   Take your time to order your food... and it'll be many moments before your food arrives; many moments between courses. But who's keeping time?Service staff are pleasant. It's a weekday night but the place is full so they are constantly on the move. Still, they are composed and unruffled. The menu has a good selection of dishes. I had the lobster bisque and lobster as main course. Excellent choices! Overall a lovely evening!"

I had the tasting menu and in the beginning you get a mere salad, but soon after you are rewarded with some good food. Nothing is overly ambitious, but cooked correctly and served professionally. I was a nice meal but not priced correctly for the tasting. Restaurant ambiance was nice and the wait staff is superb. Very patient, helpful, playful, and full of character. 4 Stars for food and staff yet overpriced tasting. My advise is to give a main meal a try, such as the delicious salmon as it was cooked perfectly and matched with a wonderful sauce and complimentary sides. It was more worth the price."

The food is truly delicious. Incredible cocktails, fresh bread and most importantly the dishes, executed impeccably. Our duck was delicious. Scallops though only 3 of them on the plate, were really good. The soup , the salad tasted fresh, prepared and presented really nice. Dessert and foie gras reminded us that we are indeed in Montreal.The service on the other hand was a total disaster. Our waitress did not bother to explain menu to us at all. After she took our orders, she disappeared completely. Even though my wife mentioned that we would like some wine with our main courses, she did not even bothered for once to stop by and ask if we like our food or if we need anything. She was running around like maniac without stopping. I guess she just did not like us. This restaurant serves souffles. Is does require 18 minutes of wait and in our humble experience, in restaurants that do serve souffle, waiters tell about it, so people can preorder instead of waiting, especially with two tired children. So no souffle for us. No questions about after dinner drinks. One would think that if tip is calculated based on the check, the waiter would at least try to offer some options even if not make our experience more pleasant but to make the  tip bigger. I guess that waiter was working for fun.We really enjoyed our food. It was great and the chef should be  kissed nightly. But if you take a great picture and hang it on the meat hooks instead of the frame, the perception is really mixed."

/user_details?userid=XisMtDDD9QGdEPxK4c4-Jg,Hilary G.,"Nashua, NH",5 star rating,"Preface:  Autumn 2008This hotel is the kind of place you could go and pretend you lived here.  From the inside, the rooms are gorgeous: high ceilings and hardwood floors.  Views overlook cobblestone and storefront-lined streets.  Walls are thick and sound does not carry, so if you tend to sleep soundly in a different bed, you might find yourself well-rested for  days of adventure in your 'new neighborhood.'    The hotel was a two-minute walk to the Notre Dame basilica.  As a tourist, walking through the church felt peripherally spiritual.  The walking tour included Rue St. Laurent which is home to top-shelf shopping, cafes, and restaurants.  This area is in close proximity to China town.  Taxi rides are minutes from fine adult entertainment and art museums.  If you want to plan ahead, you can, but it's not necessary.Although googling my trip helped, I would say that it wasn't necessary.  The spots I wanted to go overlapped the places I just discovered on my own, and the hotel staff will help you find what it is that you're looking for."

/user_details?userid=n0LmRCPynxrXYAmCElp2PQ,Nan W.,"Silver Spring, MD",5 star rating,"I went back to Bonaparte this evening after a 17-year hiatus, and this time took my husband as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. So often in this life, when you've had a memorable experience and then foolishly seek to repeat it, it fails to equal your memory... but here the second visit didn't disappoint. The meal, the classy ambiance, the completely professional service, were all just as I remembered. Being a somewhat ADD eater, I chose the $72 tasting menu (degustation) as I don't enjoy coming face to face with a whole plate of anything; I'm bored by the 4th or 5th bite.First course (lobster bisque) was beautifully balanced; so often chefs gild the lily where lobster is concerned, piling on the richness, but here, the star ingredient spoke for itself. Second course - goat cheese in phyllo - was nice but didn't ""send"" me - perhaps the weakest point in the menu - next time I'll take the home-cured salmon. But the third course, the mushroom ravioli, alone were worth the price of admission. It is the surest proof of my love for my husband that I generously gave him one whole ravioli of the four, for I could have gone on forever experiencing that particular combination of taste and texture - translucent pasta enveloping intense but not overbearing mushroom filling, the whole lightly bathed in butter. Again, the sense of balance, of not overdoing anything, of honoring tradition in French cuisine rather than grasping at the latest trend, was apparent on the plate. I doubt there's any liquid nitrogen or yuzu foam in that kitchen, and that's a good thing, for there ought to be places that don't chase food fads, yet remain worth your time and money - because what they do is both classic and superb. Then a palate-clearing pear sorbet, a perfectly timed pause, and the main course. Mine, the sole meuniere with pine nuts, was a beautifully cooked sampler in which the vegetables actually managed to outshine the protein, no insult intended to the protein. There was a mere half of cherry tomato perched atop a small phyllo coupe of spaghetti squash. Inconsequential, you would think. Yet when I bit into the tomato, the flavor sang out like the 7000-pipe organ at Notre Dame up the street. Every tiny thing on that plate was a finely carved jewel. My husband (who was eating a la carte) said his filet mignon was one of the 5 best he'd ever had - and this is a man who's been eating that particular cut at the top steakhouses of DC and other major metropolises for decades. He even ate his vegetables - unheard of! :-)Another welcome pause, with a sense of leisure for digesting all the above and enjoying conversation, ended when dessert arrived. My husband ordered the chocolate souffle and was rewarded with a gorgeously light yet substantial creation. I judged this to be the right moment to cash in my IOU from the mushroom ravioli I'd given him - I got several bites. So often I find chocolate desserts disappointing: either they're not sufficiently vivid in their chocolate-ness, or they go too far and become heavy and gummy.  Not here - the ganache was perfectly vivid without weighing anything down.My own plate, the ""dessert symphony,"" was a mini-version of the memorable plate I'd had 17 years earlier. The intense strawberry mousse, the chocolate hazelnut tower with its little crunchy bits, the creme brulee with its deliciously bitter burnt sugar crust, were all superb -- and again, the attention to tiny details rewards those who don't assume that little slice of hard-to-identify fruit atop the creme chantilly is just a decoration - it's not - it rewards with a burst of flavor all its own. My one ""whine"" is the cheesecake, which was OK but not top of the heap in the dessert universe - a bit bland when juxtaposed with its companions on the plate. We passed a lovely two-plus hours, eating and chatting in a lovely quiet alcove near the window, never feeling rushed, never having to wave franticallly for attention, never drumming our fingers and wondering when the food might appear... all these experiences, so common at other establishments, are not part of our experience with Bonaparte.  We came away replete, fulfilled, happy. Merci de tout coeur to Gerard Fort and to all the staff at Bonaparte."

The server offered to take it back, but then my wife's food would have gotten cold while I was waiting for a new plate. For $40 piece of meat, I expect it to be cooked properly the first time. Way over priced when there are such better restaurants in Old Montreal for much less."
/user_details?userid=mr52dL8Vw8tcTrfB23ykKg,Christopher M.,"Concord, MA",5 star rating,"Bonaparte is exactly what I picture when I think of a French restaurant:  very upscale, very conservative, maybe even a little bit stuffy.But the food is oh-so good!As was mentioned by another Yelper, this is definitely the kind of establishment that attracts the more experienced generations.  I think we were the youngest patrons by at least a decade.  And be sure to dress appropriately; this is definitely a skirt & blazer kind of establishment.But unlike many French restaurants you find in the States, conservative does not equal pretentious at Bonaparte.  Our server was happy to engage us in French, instead of forcing the conversation to English as many French speakers will do.  He was friendly and engaging and enthusiastically gave recommendations throughout the meal.  He was everything you could hope for in restaurant service.And the food was excellent - some of the best traditional French I've ever had.  I'd highly recommend the Duck Confit, the Escargot and the House Foie Gras.The wine list was also awesome.  I could have spent the day just talking wine with the waiter.  Even if you don't usually drink wine at a restaurant, I'd recommend you indulge here.My only regret:  in hindsight we should have chosen the tasting menu.  I can only imagine."

I was seated at a table by the window, which was on  a lovely narrow cobbled lane. I started with the salad, which was lovely and dressed perfectly. Then came the salmon tartare, delicious.  Next was an intermezzo (palate cleansing sorbet). My entree was barramundi, which may one of the best fish dishes I have ever eaten in my life; simply prepared, but bursting with fresh flavor. I would have licked my plate clean if I didn't hope to return there someday. For dessert I chose a creme caramel, which was the only part of the meal which, while fine, did not wow me.  My glass of pinot grigio was pretty good and only $7, very reasonable for a restaurant of that caliber. Service was perfectly balanced between attentiveness and allowing me to dine in peace and eat a my leisurely pace.I absolutely intend to go back when I visit Montreal again.c;est magnifique!"

Had a creme brulee top and the foie gras was really creamy. I liked it, but the toasts were more like pound cake.Snails in parsley fricassee and Provençale style vegetables - A little dissapointed. The escargot was not very flavorful. Was overpowered by the sauce.Pear and tarragon sorbet (intermezzo) - Very refreshingBreast of duck flavored with maple syrup and berries - Dissapointed. The breast was very chewy. Probably the worst course of the night and it is suppose to be the main entree. I had a taste of the filet mignon and it was better than my dish but not awesome.Symphonie of desserts - Desserts were goodtea or coffee - I opted for tea and they give you a teapot.

/user_details?userid=kVHj7VqkGiqB3Tgas1KgtQ,Saundra C.,"Amherst, NH",3 star rating,The meal was excellent. Unfortunately the service was not. Let me explain... I ordered a glass of Pinot noir with my duck. When it arrived I took a sip and noticed a small bug/fly floating in it. I picked it out but upon closer inspection realized there were about 5 more floating in the wine. I called the waiter over and there was no apology though he did bring another glass of wine and he opened this bottle in front me me before he poured it. Nothing else was said and I wondered whether the restaurant would charge me. It turned out that when the bill came ($202) I was charged for the $11 glass of wine. Honestly I thought this was poor customer service from a yelp 4 star restaurant. I would not go back again.

One of the appetizers, foie gras creme brûlée was a little weird. Look like a little cup of regular crème brûlée, with the sweet crusted topping. However, The creamy interior had a very very faint taste of liver. Did not care for the dish. It was accompanied by a brown sweet ginger bread. My partner, however, did like this dish. The other appetizer parenthesis one scallop) was tasty, but not outstanding. My partner had the shrimp, and was blessed with two pieces parenthesis (LOL). My partner had the duck entrée and I had the fillet mignon. Both were OK but not outstanding. For dessert, they gave us a tray of assorted cakes. The wine was reasonable for the restaurant: $39 (Can) for French Chardonnay. On balance, it was a lovely experience for both of us. A romantic place for a special dinner. But, I've had better French food."
/user_details?userid=yaNUJo62LN2i3gBlb2c2zQ,Mike W.,"Hudson, NY",4 star rating,"While I didn't hit up the restaurant portion, my girlfriend and I did stay for a weekend (circa November 2006) at the inn due to a recommendation from a friend who had lived in Montreal for a bit. The inn can definitely be described as a place for older couples. We were definitely the youngest ones around, which didn't bother us at all but might have bothered others around us. We weren't going to be loud or obnoxious, so please, stop giving us dirty looks.Perfectly situated in the older section of Montreal, the inn is within walking distance of many of the sites within old Montreal. We were also able to easily access any place outside of the older section while never being that far away from our hotel. More on the actual inn.We went during the off season (November) and spend $165/ night for the most basic room; a room with a queen sized bed and a complete bathroom. The room had views of a cathedral and its gardens, which probably would have been beautiful in the spring, but was not very impressive in the fall (obviously not the fault of the garden). Now, I'm not really accustomed to nice hotels, so I was quite impressed with the elegant hardwood floors, the wall sconce equipped with dimmers, the comfortable bed, the clean bathroom...etc etc. Perhaps I'm not the best one to say this, but it's definitely one of the nicest hotel rooms I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. Breakfast the next morning was excellent, if a bit less filling than my usual morning meal.  Overall, the vibe was cozy, classy, intertwined with a bit of old school charm."

/user_details?userid=Hh1D1GXjkgPXuusHFSp3NQ,Doc M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Firstly, as a generic tip, I think it's always wise to take reviews from tourists with a grain of salt (as opposed to reviews by locals). Tourists from countries that lack the French charm that Montreal has to offer are so starry-eyed by the restaurants near the old port that pretty much every restaurant gets a five-star (I'm sure the wine, and the fact that one is on vacation also add to the feel-good all around). Montrealers, on the other hand, are used to good food, and consider anything that doesn't match up to the high standards not worth it, especially if you're spending a fortune for your food. In this regard, we really didn't think that Bonaparte deserves more than one star. The food was average, our server kept forgetting our request for a wine list, and for menus, and was, on the whole, most unhelpful (although profoundly apologetic for her clumsiness). The ambience is good, but if your looking for a delicious French meal, there are many better options in the city (Try Entrepont, an exponentially better experience, or Le P'tit Plateau, or Toroli if you like to try fusion French food).Overall, not worth the price at all."
/user_details?userid=YsD8bQt0IWCCGZeHXQiIuQ,Max K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I have been to Restaurant Bonaparte several times, but as I am new to Yelp I am now writing a review of this, one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal, for the first time. My recent visit was on July 17th, when a small group of 9 of us went there to celebrate a birthday.  In fact, all of us had been there before, most often to celebrate the birthday of the same person we were celebrating this time. We were not looking for surprises, just for good food and a lovely evening, and we were not disappointed.I have given the Bonaparte five stars because everybody in our party was very happy with their meals and with the wine.  However, I do hesitate about the five stars for one reason: this menu has almost nothing for vegetarians.  There are just a few choices among the starters that have no meat, and nothing is appropriate for vegans. I ordered their salad of mixed greens despite the grated parmesan on it, and it was excellent.  For my main dish I had a dinner-sized portion of their one vegetarian appetizer, the mushroom ravioli. They also gave me some vegetables with it to make it into a main dish.  This is in fact what I have every time I go to the Bonaparte, and knowing that it is the only thing on the menu for me does not stop me from going back.  It is delicious.  Most of the rest of the people in my party had the rack of lamb, again knowing in advance from past experience that they would like it (we must not be an adventurous lot).The other thing I look forward to when I go to the Bonaparte is their lime meringue pie.  I order it right away because I do not want to take any chances that there be none left when I am ready for dessert, although they always assure me that they will not run out.  Most of the rest of our party also indulged in the lime pie.  Yum!The atmosphere at the Bonaparte is very pleasant, the waiters are attentive, and the noise level is about average.  Some little corners or nooks in the restaurant are especially pleasant for a party of two or three.  Now, if they would just add some vegetarian options to their menu, they would be perfect!"

Service really can make or break a meal and here the service made the meal. We got the 6 course tasting menu and it seemed that the dishes went from great to just good. The mixed green salad was nice but nothing special as it was a few simple ingredients. The lobster bisque was good but not anything special either. The goat cheese pastry was fabulous and the foie gras creme brulee was an interesting twist on a classic. I loved the mushroom ravioli it was fantastic. The duck was too tough and not enjoyable. The sauce on the steak was too rich and also not something we liked. We were able to swap one of the desserts for the chocolate souffle but it seemed undercooked and extremely eggy compared to other souffles that I've had. The sampler of desserts was nice particularly the creme brulee, cheesecake and the chocolate one."

Duck leg was a bit over cooked and dry on the edges. My veal was also overcooked from medium rare...no pinkish center at all. But fortunately, the quality of the meat was good, so it was tender still....but i would have prefered it a bit rarer.dessert was very good.souffle was big! i dont know how they got it to be so fluffly and perfect! it was injected with yummy chocolate which worked wonderfully.

The lamb itself was cooked perfectly.I can't remember what else the group ordered but everyone left very pleased. Maybe it was because of the 2 bottles of wine we ordered?

Both meals came with pureed carrots (I didn't know that was a thing, but it was delicious). For my birthday dessert they put a little sparkler on my chocolate mousse (equally delicious) which was a nice gesture to my birthday.

All four of us ordered the Table d'Hote, as this perhaps is the most value-for-money choices in any Monteal restaurants. For only 30.95 dollars, the food and service beats the so-called Restaurant Week menus to dirt. I had venison terrine as an appetizer. They were very well seasoned and richly flavored. I had steak for my entree, it was quite nicely done. Although I have had better ones, I have also paid twice more for the steak. For this price, it's unbeatable.

You probably think ""Napoleon"" like I do, the French Revolution military leader we all learned about in 7th grade History class. However, due to the ratings on Yelp, I decided to give it a try with my Account Executive for dinner on a Thursday evening (9PM res) while in one of my favorite cities in North America to travel to. It was also closely located to the Le Westin Montreal (my GO TO hotel every time I'm in Montreal) giving it an edge over the other locations I was contemplating (within a quick 4 minute walk of the Westin). We saw their multitude of menus but quickly settled on the $32.95CAD ""TABLE D'HOTE"" prixe fixe that had a very large selection of items which were spread across 3 courses + coffee/tea would make almost all diners happy for a relatively low price. Here's how it went down:+ Venison terrine with cranberries and herbs. It was quite good, very meatloafy in consistency which is what most terrines should be. It was quite meaty, herby, perfectly salted and great to be spread on some carbs like WE did.+ Lamb Rack with brussel sprouts and onions. It was very juicy, done perfectly medium-rare and lollipop style/Frenched as it should be. After all, you ARE in a French restaurant right?+ Buffalo Flank with green peppercorn. My AE had ordered this and it was ""pretty good"" according to him. I had a piece of it and it was definitely good. Not the best buffalo flank I've had but not the worst either. + Cheese Plate. We had a goat's cheese, a sheep's milk and a cow cheese that were equally yummy. The firm sheep's milk cheese was quite yummy and creamy while the others were very good too. They paired quite well with our Cab Sav that we had.+ Chocolate Mousse. One of the best chocolate mousses I've ever had...it was done to perfectly, firm yet creamy, consistent and damn smooth. Probably one of the best items of the evening.Overall? It was a very good experience...it was definitely quite busy and filled with Americans (tourists like me) and the service was fine and efficient. I will definitely return, however there are many other Frenchy spots in Montreal that I'd love to try.THIS has been a review by Gaurav"

Initially, we had a reservation at 6 PM but had a MUCH too full lunch so we ended up pushing our dinner way later at 10 PM. Even at 9:30, there was a half hour wait for dinner. Man, we knew this place would be good. The ambiance is definitely romantic and the dim lighting sets the mood for a good night on the town. The service was so-so. Our waiter was quite busy and didn't attend to us too much but that was okay. I ordered the Escargot in a puff pastry while the SO got onion soup. The escargot was pretty good and the fact that it was in a puff pastry and no tin the typical trays for escargot was a little sad for me but it definitely screamed snail for me. The onion soup was oniony. Not the two best highlights for me that night. However, when I got duck confit, it was absolute heaven. I never had duck that was so soft with a skin that was borderline crunchy and too tough (depending on what you like). I loved that duck along with the sauce that the duck was cooked in. It was also quite juicy and delicious as well! However, my SO's salmon was not the best and the portion size he got was smaller than we had thought. However, that makes sense since it is a French restaurant so meat is king. After the appetizer and entree, we were totally stuffed to the brim. NO MORE, NO MORE, we were screaming. I would probably not go back again unless we were going to get the prix fixe menus."

/user_details?userid=yTd8NoA4N5cXIrfESzjjeg,Daniel C.,"Livingston, NJ",5 star rating,"This is my first 5-star review of a restaurant, but it's well deserved.  My wife and I planned to be in town.  So I did some research in advance to decide which 2 places we were going to try.  We picked Bonaparte and Europea, which I just reviewed.  The reservation was easily made online, and it was for a Friday evening sitting.  Remarkably, the place was not full.  But perhaps that was because Canadians were celebrating Canada Day the day before and extending into the weekend.We were placed by a window looking out onto the street.  It was a great spot.  The staff were also very attentive, which always goes a long way with me.To start, I had the duck foie gras creme brulee, which I completely devoured and cleaned my ramekin using morsels of bread.  Despite it being duck foie gras, it still tasted great and I enjoyed every bit.  My wife had the lobster salad, which also tasted great.  The lobster was cooked to perfection.For the entrees, I had the lobster stew which I admittedly also devoured completely.  Perhaps I was hungrier than usual that evening, but the lobster was again cooked to perfection.  There was also a lot of lobster.  But my favorite part was the sauce that had the vanilla and muscat wine.  Like the creme brulee, I used morsels of bread to clean the plate.My wife had the sauteed scallops with truffle oil and mushrooms.  My couple of bites of the dish had me wanting more.Overall, this was a fantastic place to try and I'm glad we did.  Similar to my comment in my review of Europea, we skipped the prix fixe menus in order to try some of the dishes that we absolutely wanted."

I had a 7-course meal (from what I remember) and each dish was delicious. Dishes were plated really nicely. Each dish did not contain huge portions, but was perfect to be able to taste everything and yet be very filling. A bit on the expensive side ($70) but the small quiet place with excellent service made it a worthwhile eat."
/user_details?userid=qdiW44eFp2iloiXTiYyaAQ,Cynthia A.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"The food is excellent. They have a pre fix menu which is the best choice. Every time I have been here the service, food and ambiance has been outstanding. Not a place for kids and when I am in Montreal with my kids my only regret is not being able to dine here. Everything is cooked to perfection and the food melts in your mouth. A little on the expensive side but worth every dollar."

Everyone enjoyed what they  ordered and prices don't need to be expensive if you order from the table d'hôte which had some great selections. Would plan a return visit if in the area or reccomend it others looking for great dining experience."

/user_details?userid=4SikH0-H_23v12tE3MLhqA,Annie V.,"Coxsackie, NY",5 star rating,"I can't say enough good things about both the hotel and the restaurant parts of Bonaparte. My parents and I walked into the hotel without a reservation on a Sunday evening. The staff was extremely friendly and accomodating, and was able to provide us with a beautiful room for slightly less than other hotels that are rated $$ on yelp. We didn't spend much time in the room, but it was absolutely lovely -- a double and a queen bed, double jacuzzi tub, clean, quiet, and with a view of the back of the Notre-Dame Basilica! The room rate also included breakfast at Bonaparte Restaurant -- the French Toast, made with French bread from the previous night's dinner service was out of this world. There was also parking available for a small fee ($10?), free wi-fi, and a computer and printer for guests in the lounge.We also ate dinner at Bonaparte restaurant, and loved it. My dad and I are big foodies, while my mom has pretty simple tastes, and we all agreed it was one of the best meals we'd ever had. Recommendations: The lobster special w/ vanilla-muscat sauce sounded like it would be too sweet, but was perfect. The mushroom ravioli was exquisite, with paper-thin pasta encasing an amazingly complex mushroom filling. And the fois gras duo was perfect fois... need I say more? The steak tartare was huge, and in my opinion a little overseasoned, but that may just have been because it was my third course, and I was approaching saturation by that point. By far the best feature of both the hotel and restaurant was the service, which was unobtrusive but amazingly considerate. Examples: my dad mentioned that we were celebrating my graduation from grad school, and the server brought me a complementary little bottle of ice cider that paired perfectly with my fois. (And a pen from the restaurant, which was a cute touch.) Even better, I went down to the lounge to read at about 11:30 pm. I was worried that since it was so late, they might be closing up. But I sat down in the empty lounge and started reading... within 5 minutes, the music had been changed to a soft instrumental track, candles were lit on all the tables, the fireplace was turned on, and the waiter from dinner appeared to offer me ""something to help me read."" Amazing, and totally exemplary of the entire experience at Bonaparte -- the staff didn't just make sure we had a nice time, but obviously enjoyed our enjoyment of the whole weekend. I could live there."

The staff is very friendly and service is excellent. The food is truly scrumptious. An out and out French experience. I tried their 5 course set menu and it is just perfect.
/user_details?userid=XyhyqL-_QKdrKWJ5h6BW8w,Alexandra C.,"New Port Richey, FL",4 star rating,"My husband and I honeymooned in Montreal and saved this for our one fancy dinner of the week because of the recommendations we received on Yelp.  First off- the food was amazing.  We are not foodies but everything on our plates was just excellent.  Their menu is extensive and their prices are not ridiculous and I felt like we really got our monies worth. We were seated the moment we walked in the door, even early for our reservation, and the service was great until......the power went out.  Totally not their fault- the entire city grid was out due to some unknown problem.  But that was when their service pretty much ended.  They left us in the dark (literally) for at least 30 minutes.  While the restaurant across the street already put candles on all the tables, we went without.  We had no idea what was happening or what that would mean for the rest of our meal (we were halfway through our entree at the time of the outage).  When they did come back to our table, they acted like nothing that happened.  I can appreciate the stress they were under and know that it is not easy to deal with that, but it would have been nice to be checked on a little more and explained what was happening while we were sitting in almost pitched darkness. The manager brought over a candle and even mentioned the fact that it was our honeymoon, but never offered anything to help with the fact that our dinner was cut short and we were left sitting in an un-air conditioned building in 80 degree weather.  There were a few additional missteps along the way (our bill was incorrect but was fixed, etc), but even with all that, it still was the best meal we've ever had.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could."
