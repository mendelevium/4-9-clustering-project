/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",5 star rating,Heard about this place for quite some time but never got to try it until tonight.My rating is based on the original chicken cutlet with salt and pepper + spicy. Asked the person at the counter about the most popular item and that's what he recommended.Chicken was juicy and extra crispy. $9.99 for a huge piece of chicken that is way bigger than your face. Bursting with flavour and drove 30 mins home and the chicken was still crispy. Of course I had a few bites while it was still hot :)Could only eat half of the chicken and will finish the rest tomorrow. I think it is a good bargain for what you get and definitely will fill you up.Would try the other flavours next time.
/user_details?userid=fg19inoXzEtUYQEcTwJ1Ww,Calvin H.,"San Diego, CA",3 star rating,"Hot Star is like a dedicated place just for the best part of a Taiwanese boba joint...the crispy chicken. You know, the tender chicken pieces breaded and seasoned with hot spice.I ordered the large chicken breast which is flattened out and relatively thin. It's fried to order and comes served to you in a wax paper bag, perfect for eating on the go. I tried to eat an entire one by myself. It's physically doable but not the greatest idea. The spices and flavor are good but overall with all the oil and breading, it's a very heavy meal and you may be feeling a big sluggish afterwards. Given the chance, I'd probably still do it again though."
/user_details?userid=iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,David M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Well, I was wondering what all the fuss and buzz was and had to try this on a cold day.The chicken piece is gargantuan, but it's not sturdy and flops about so it's not edible standing up.The issue is they serve it on a paper sleeve and the oils and sauce seep through. By the end there is direct contact between the food and the cafeteria tray.The flavour of the special BBQ was just ok, tasted just like soja to me.The chicken wings were gigantic as well, almost the size of a can of coke but again the Korean sauce was a letdown and there was just too much breading.It's an amazing value if you just want a hot protein snack as the $10 price is more than enough for 2 people."
/user_details?userid=Mt-_SvJyDirR9fpZx9dbEw,Tommy S.,"Bellevue, WA",3 star rating,"Hot Star is a jumbo fried chicken eatery chain from Taiwan. While the concept sounds promising, the execution is a bit slow in my opinion. The ordering process is fairly simple: expect fast-food industry service. Be prepared for a delay after ordering, as the wait can be protracted. I usually just order their classic giant fried chicken, and it usually takes 12 minutes. Twice, I was the sole patron and both times it actually took 15 minutes. The chicken is utterly delicious, so I'm not as annoyed once I get my order. There's no accounting for taste, so you need to assess for yourself if it's worth waiting 10-15 minutes at a *fast*-food joint. For me: 3/5"
/user_details?userid=i8q-S7WFNkfgOVBx7K6tPw,Yao W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"WOW! The curry XXL fried chicken (11.50$) cutlet was the bomb! The chicken inside was tender and the outer breadcrumb layer is super crisp. It says that the original store is in the Taipei Shilin Night Market, so the chicken is served in a plastic bag just like how you'd get it there. It closes at 11 pm so it's perfect for some 夜宵 (aka night time cravings) - especially after watching the Green Book and it reminding you constantly of how good fried chicken can be... Will definitely be coming back to try their seaweed fried chicken! 4.5 stars. CAVEAT: although the place gives a fast food chain vibe, it takes about 15-20 minutes to get your number called."
/user_details?userid=wW72FaqNPv6pdBC6AUqvcA,Hilary K.,"Vaudreuil-Dorion, Canada",4 star rating,"New restaurant it seemed like it was the old quick burger joint .. they did a complete gut job and put a fancy fried chicken franchise from Taiwan! The Chicken was AMAZING. !!!!! Im glad I found this place! Atmosphere is very nice and spacious. Beautiful place!The food was DELICIOUSSERVICE WAS SUPER FRIENDLY!Food: FANTASTIC! Chicken tender and moistPopcorn chicken was AMAZING and crispy, usually I'm use to crappy soggy popcorn chicken that is so condensed to fit in the barrel. However, the packet is really small and they don't put enough in the packet. The fries were delicious and crispy again not much given My only negative comment is the price!You get a thin slice of chicken don't get me wrong taste amazing and fresh but a combo costs 16.99... very price for on slice of chicken and a few fries.They oblige you to buy the whole combo even if you don't want it and only want the chicken.Overall, great find and if you are craving fried chicken it's amazing and so worth trying don't know if I'll be back at the price point but definitely do recommend trying it once !It's a nice resto with delicious Fried chicken food , just wish they were a bit more generous. It's very small for what you pay so I feel a bit ripped off but the flavours are amazing!"
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"As a fast food eatery with small menu, its waiting time is annoying. I always had popcorn chicken 7$ or the big chicken 10$. I usually add spicy chili powder. Recently I found the chicken was a bit dry and very chewy. Overall it's kinda salty, I need water badly every time I eat it."
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Read about this spot on the Montreal Blog. Husband and I were out for errands and decided to grab a bite here. We got the one meal of Spicy Crispy Chicken with fries and a drink to share. Our total was around $18 excluding tip. Chicken was tender and tasty. Fries were extremely good and the margarita lime drink was one of our favourite parts of the experience. Definitely worth trying once but wouldn't necessarily come here again.
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Yaaay large fried chicken comes to Montreal too! Compared to the location in Toronto, I found that the quality is better here. The breading is less thick and not hard and or overcooked. The chicken was freshly fried and super juicy on the inside, delicious! They serve the regular one in a variety of flavours (seaweed, salt and pepper, curry, plum), as well as a korean flavoured one and a cheese one. The popcorn chicken was ok, flavoured well but a bit too heavy on the crispy batter.  My only complaint is that the food is a bit too salty, and the price is a bit high for one large piece of chicken. Seating is pretty limited, but guests can finish a thing of chicken relatively quickly so it might not be a problem? Service speed is OK because they do say they fry their chicken fresh to order.Would come again!"
/user_details?userid=PALLpd-wFfmp48inCockgg,Shaun Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I went to this store in China many times and once in Toronto and really happy to see one open in Montreal! It is good to have a fried chicken from them once a while. The portion of chicken is huge and I cannot finish it in one meal. It is better to order one or two side dishes and share with a friend. The drinks are nice too!
/user_details?userid=9nj5lry5KkSal22Oo9VGvQ,Cayla L.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing fried chicken! I came here a few times already and they never disappoint me! The crispy fried chicken with extra spicy is my favourite. Their fries are quite good but there is one thing on the menu that isn't advertised enough... The fried king oyster mushroom is to die for!! It is quite expensive for what you are paying but it's really delicious. I also really enjoy their blue drink with the spicy chicken. Can't wait to go back again!! One tip: pay for the extra 50 cents for the larger drink if you're planning to get your chicken extra spicy, it's going to help !"
/user_details?userid=M90aCs0T0ZkWnXSpJZHpbw,Hsin-Yi W.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,We found this place by accident and we all loved it! Hot star is a really famous fried chicken brand in Taiwan so we are familiar with what they serve. The food is quite decent if you like Taiwanese style fried food but not really impressive. We loved the sweet potato fries most and felt the fried mushroom was not good enough.
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious taiwanese fried chicken. You can get many different flavors such as salt and pepper, seaweed, korean, etc. The outside is crispy anf flavorful and the inside is very moist and tender. It wasn't too oily. It has a piece of bone inside. They also have combos as well as colorful drinks. One original piece of chicken is around 10$. The only down part is the long waiting time. We probably waited 10 min for our chicken and it wasn't that crowded. Can't imagine the wait time during peak hours. Would definitely come back to try their other flavors."
/user_details?userid=GbDfPbqp7gKRwbn116KDSA,Ben K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"""Taiwan #1!""In all seriousness, though, this isn't the best chicken, it's serviceable. My massive Taiwanese schnitzel (mein reisige taiwanische Schnitzel?) comes healthily hammered in the deep fryer and housed in a veritable winter duvet of nondescript BBQ seasoning. When it comes to deep fried goodness, my threshold for enjoyment is measured by how much alcoholic imbibage must first occur for me to think this is the best freakin' chicken in the world. God only knows how appetizing the KFC at Sherbrooke and Decarie looks after a night of drinking.Right. And if zéro déchet is your thing, best to avoid this place, which is marked by a distinct lack of non-petroleum based cutlery and paper bag-based chinaware.Alcohol threshold of enjoyment: 5 gin and tonics"
/user_details?userid=bH--sW5TemoGHFDS5mkUbQ,Jazzy13023 J.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"They F my order . Ordered the hot spicy chicken and got the regular chicken . Tried to explain to the cashier but she didn't want to listen to me . Honestly they didn't care much and I'm not picky . I paid 50 cents more so it's not such a big deal . Otherwise the chicken is pretty HOTTT and good . Do not try to walk and eat the chicken, not a good idea . Came back to the resto to sit and eat the chicken . It's worth it . An experience."
/user_details?userid=k4xzJyW2FPMvy4TMUs4D0Q,Jeff T.,"Dollard-Des Ormeaux, Canada",2 star rating,"Hot Star is new take on fast food . It is a little restaurant  that has limited seating -14 people . The staff was not very friendly or helpful. They were sold out of Korean chicken on a Saturday night @5pm . We ordered 4 different chicken meals - original, BBQ, battered, and chicken tenders with orders of fries and sweet potatoes. Expect to wait for your order 10 to 15 mins. All 4 orders of The chicken were juicy and very tender. The sweet potatoes were amazing but for the size and the price it was expensive . Hot Star was good but to pay 10 to $16 per order of chicken ( no side dishes) is way to expensive When you are eating take out ... no problem paying $25 -$30 in a nice restaurant with good service  .  Overall I liked the food would give it 4 Stars  the price and the bad attitude of the people working there they get a 1 star . Unfortunately we were disappointed ."
/user_details?userid=i0k6PsaA2E17fmNck1Pmsg,Morteza B.,"Portola Springs, Irvine, CA",3 star rating,It is good but not best fried chicken I've ever tried. I am not sure about the spices that they use but it has a taste of garlic and it is a alittle bit sweet which was not my favorite. probably I should try the spicy one
/user_details?userid=FOjn2xFi-LK_292mRjCglQ,Rowena L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,The Chicken is Huge. Bigger than your Face!! Hot Crispy and Deliscious! Would definitely go back!
/user_details?userid=VseHlPAVhHbNZqyl_zRKBQ,Stephanie C.,"Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"After seeing people eat giant fried chicken cutlets, I had to come try this place! I decided to try their regular fried chicken cutlet with salt and pepper, along with their Litchi Rose drink, which came up to around 16$ - which is a little pricey. While other reviews mentioned long wait times, my food was ready in about 10mins. The fried chicken was huge and okay, which tasted like your average Taiwanese fried chicken. Also, beware of the many bones and cartilage at the bottom of the cutlet which can be quite annoying. As for their drink, the litchi rose was so good but quite pricey as well (5$ for a regular/small). Overall, the food is a little pricey for what it is but their drinks are quite tasty. I don't think the food is worth it's price, you can find other Taiwanese restaurants for cutlets for much cheaper and better taste - like Mon Chicha or Sugar Marmalade. While it's not a place that I would come often to, I may come back when craving for a chicken cutlet to go. Unless you're planning on buying just a chicken cutlet, expect to spend 16-23$ for a cutlet, drink and a side."
/user_details?userid=3E5Pfenz8zVScQc2nkQPCA,Dave L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Strange, but interesting concept. It works, ya know. I got this gigantic chicken thing from here, it was really big, like a supersized chicken thigh, except that the meat tasted and look kind of fake (but edible!) even though there were real chicken bones in the thing (proves that it was real chicken meat, I guess, lol). Overall it's nice, good spicy sauce if I remember correctly (or maybe I added it myself, don't remember!), would recommend that you try at least once, if you think you'd be into that sort of thing."
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I learned about this place through instagram. We were driving by and saw this place. Decided to give it a try. Having read all good reviews, I had high expectations, which this restaurant did not live up to. Tried the Fried chicken and the spicy chicken wings - HORRIBLE! The fried chicken had a huge bone in it and the spicy chicken tasted bitter because of the red chilly powder. Never going back here."
/user_details?userid=bRVkrBu_35uizf2h1OQ8Mw,Dan Y.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Tried a few different flavours of fried chicken - salt and pepper, seaweed, and spicy.  All tasty and large portion.  Got some combos as well with fries and drinks ($16.50 for combo).  Chicken were made to order so you'd have to wait a bit (we waited probably 15 mins and it wasn't busy)"
/user_details?userid=8EclJ24l7H0J-GC5tvegcg,Léonie L.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Good fried chicken. Very tender and juicy. You can ask for the level of spice you want. Sitting area is small and always packed.Waiting time is long (15-20min) but it's freshly-fried.A little bit pricey. The chicken itself is 10$ and with the meal (fries + drink) and taxes it's about 18-20$. Though, when I really want fried chicken I go there ~ one of the best I had :)"
/user_details?userid=jxcXExWgrObwx5AL8-LMbA,Nazim A.,"Downtown, Canada",5 star rating,"I read about this place and decided I had to try it as I am a fried chicken enthusiast. This place exceeded expectations so much that I came back for a second day in a row. In my opinion, 10$ for a big cutlet of fried chicken is perfectly priced and very satisfying. I also ordered the king oyster mushrooms (5$) and the fried banana with condensed milk (5$)for the perfect meal. The bone is a bit of nuisance however, there are clear instructions on how to enjoy it best. All in all, the fried chicken is great, the king oyster mushrooms are unique and yummy and the banana is a perfect dessert!  I will be back!"
/user_details?userid=knCg1M9Gf4v2-95YzAG4DQ,Paul L.,"Greenfield Park, Canada",5 star rating,"This Taiwanese chicken has become one of my favourites after being introduced years ago by my Taiwanese friend in MongKok, Hong Kong. Well worth the wait made to order and your number is called immediately. I'd say the taste's as good original recipe in Hong Kong & Taiwan. Just watch out for the bones in the big cutlets."
/user_details?userid=IJspW-KhaV8ayA2wzcstUg,Wolfgang L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had the original chicken, fried mushrooms and fried corn on the cob. Everything had a distinct​ flavor​ of 5 spice, particularly​ the corn.The chicken is really good. A nice crispy batter, covering a butterflied (rib bones in) chicken breast. The chicken is cooked to perfection, still juicy but not raw. I'm a big guy, and the chicken is frankly too much fried food​ to eat solo in one sitting. The mushrooms were​ not something I would order again, as it's more of the same batter, and they are too rubbery for my taste.The corn was something I wanted to try, as I had heard it's a popular side dish in Asia. It was not bad but I'm not sure what frying it brought to the table, the kernels where kind of mushy, and the whole thing tased too much like 5 spice. I'm glad I tried it but would not order it again.My advice is: go for the chicken. Get just the chicken​ and a drink. Better have a salad for your other meal that day..."
