The banh mi was sublime and will go back. The thing I don't understand is the $$$$ (4x$ ??) - it is really not that expensive... no more than $$ for sure."
/user_details?userid=RxPndFw7sdSX4hWMbIJBGQ,Philippe G.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,"Food is good and service is friendly and quick. When in the area and looking for a quick bite this is a good place to try. Their banh mi sandwich are good, the ingredient tastes fresh but I would add a bit more sauce to it. The broth of their pho also tastes great and the options are good. The only thing I'm disappointed of is that they don't have the pho special a.k.a the all dress.Rush starts around 11h45 and is non stop for the duration of the lunch time. It can be quite impressive to see the amount of people they serve considering the size of the establishment.And one major plus compared to a lot of the places in the area: they accept credit and debit."
/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Not sure why this is priced four dollar signs ($$$$), as it is definitely not an expensive place. Good bang for your buck, not very memorable but a quick and decent meal.A good restaurant to get 'to-go' food at during lunch breaks. My favorite to order are the spring rolls (not imperial rolls) which are great. The rice paper and ingredients used are clearly fresh, you should order this if you go there! It's the main thing I get excited for and that keeps me coming back. The fried dumplings are OK and so is the Pho and won-ton soups. If you're in the area and are feeling like Vietnamese food, give it a shot - but I wouldn't go in this area just to try this restaurant."

The service is pleasant & the atmosphere is busy but friendly. I got a beef Pho soup which was 11.25$ and pretty good! Salty without adding anything to it but delicious none the less. My only complaint would be that the there are only a few Pho soup spoons in the less than clean utensil holder (see photos). I had to share my Hoisin & siracha with the next table over which was fine albeit mildly awkward. You also have to request hot oil if you want it as it's not on the table. All in all Sencha is a fine spot for Pho, I'll be coming again due to its good soup and convenient location to my office."

They freshly cook the chicken and bun, making a delicious toasty sandwich. Better than vua or any pre-made sandwiches. Highly recommend. Super nice staff, all women and hard working."
/user_details?userid=ScBtjcPsr6Ru_AM95vyY7Q,Jasmine N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The service is really fast, the people there are really nice and the food is AMAZING! It really tastes like traditional Asian cuisine for an affordable price. You can either get take out or sit down with your friends either way you know you're going to enjoy yourself. The owner is a hard worker but still has time to chat, she's really sweet.All in all 100% recommend."

You want real food that's not overpriced go here. The pho is delicious as are the other dishes. And the people that run the place are lovely.
