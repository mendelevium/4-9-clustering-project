/user_details?userid=RtUkSBvInr8mi6-I-PQWoA,Jim G.,"Spring, TX",5 star rating,"Very nice place. Great, friendly service. We dropped in mainly for food. We didn't want a big meal and the servings and quality here are perfect. The three of us shared lamb meatballs, the duck rillette plate, the sausage plate and a bread plate. All excellent. Hard to find because the sign is almost non-existent but well worth hunting for (a great wine selection too though we didn't imbibe)"

The young couple who own this place are passionate and nerdy about coffee and wine and I could listen to them talk and sample their delicious wares for days. Can't wait to head back to go another wine adventure and get to dig properly into their dishes!"
/user_details?userid=w2c6Xzt-0ZKMDJ7DYsm9PQ,Elaine L.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,Amazing coffee shop! Came here on a Friday to do some work and found out that everything on the drinks menu was only for $2!!!!! We got an americano and a small mocha. They also had a bowl of chocolate chip cookies just for people to eat and enjoy- and it was delicious! Really enjoyed this shop and certainly will come back whenever I need to get some work done.

H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Walked by and decided to stop in for a coffee but was seduced by a pile of chocolate chip cookies that would not let me leave without taking one home.  So glad I followed my heart.  Oh and any Aussies or Kiwis in town?  They have flat whites!
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I went to Monopole on a Friday night. The initial plan was just to stop in for a glass of wine and an appetizer and the go somewhere else for dinner but we ended up staying till past midnight and had dinner and wine there. We each started with a glass of red wine and shared the parsnip, bacon and aïoli dish. Before then I don't think I ever ate parsnips but it was surprisingly good! It was my favorite dish and yet it was pretty simple. Then we had the cavatelli with pumpkin and chanterelles mushroom followed by another glass of red wine. The pasta was also pretty delicious.  Lastly we had the Jerusalem artichoke because two of the staff recommended it. Unfortunately it was my least favorite dish.  It was ok. It tasted a bit smokey to me and I'm not really a fan of that. I thought it would be good because they put a layer of cheese and then flame it. I really enjoyed the red wines. There was two that I particularly enjoyed. My favorite out of the two was the Cardin. I think they change the wine selection and even the food menu pretty often. Although the wine and food were good, I'm mainly giving this place five stars because of the service. I was very impressed with the owner. He came around taking our order and at one point we wanted to try another glass of red wine and he said "" follow me... "" then we went into the wine cellar and he let us try all the red wine bottles he had opened that night! There must have been five wines that were open! It was fun doing a bit of wine tasting! That was so nice of him ! There was one bottle in particular that we really enjoyed but there was only about a glass and a half left so he gave us what was left of the bottle for the price of one glass. That's pretty generous of him. This wine bar specializes mainly in vegetable dishes and let me tell you these dishes are so tasty! In all honesty think it helps that it is served with a lot of cream or with other ingredients that make it flavourful like bacon or cheese. I'm not a big fan of veggies but if veggies were normally served like this I think I would eat it more. I will definitely be back and I highly recommend it!! This place is a six min walk from my boyfriend's condo so it's very convenient! I'm also curious to try their meat dishes because we sat at the bar and the pan seared pork shoulder dish looked so good!"
/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A gorgeous restaurant in Griffintown located on Wellington, close to the famous statue of Source on Bonaventure expressway. I went there on the quiet day, which is Saturday, to try their brunch, which changes regularly depending on the inspiration of the cook. From Monday to Friday they serve coffee, lunch and supper, but then weekend they have the brunch and close earlier than usual. The wine at Monopole is a big selling point, since the owners take much pride in it, and actually name the restaurant Monopole because they love the manga Les Gouttes de Dieu so much and the protagonist's favorite bar is called Monopole. The plating of Monopole is really an art and their wine also remarkably good. The ambiance is super nice and the decor really tasteful. Totally recommending this place!"
/user_details?userid=CX00ixm4gz-7ploXKuuJIw,Mark L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is my favorite coffeeshop in Old Montreal! They are always super friendly and best of all, their decaf Coffee actually tastes good!! There aren't many breakfast options, but the yogurt and granola or the croissant are usually my go-to choices. Too bad they serve alcohol, so they can't be open before 8AM!"
/user_details?userid=mH5h6_Lt7t3e5LTaYR5ltA,Filip H.,"Mölndal, Sweden",5 star rating,"This is in my opinion the best food/service experience in Montreal, offering excellent value for money. The portions are generous and there's something on the menu to satisfy most people. The dishes are really good to share if you're in the mood for that and there's plenty of interesting wine and beer as well as really tasty cocktails. Favorite dishes:-Brocoli, pistachio, ricotta. Both oven rosted and cold sliced, pairing excellent with the pistachio and cheese. One of the better starts I've had to a meal.-Beef carpaccio with brussel sprouts, popcorn, tabasco infused whipped cream, parmesan and other stuff that makes it both innovative and extremely tasty. Don't miss out.The location of the place is a bit anonymous, but if you chose to go there you'll find yourself in small and cosy buvette that has higher hang-out-tables, a big round social table, and many more good spot. Or treat yourself and grab a seat infront of the chefs.This is the place you can drop by in the middle of the week, have a great meal and a nice bottle of wine without feeling that somebody obliterated your bank account. (That they're offering take-out and doubles as a café in the early hours doesn't make it worse)"
/user_details?userid=Gdyzk0Bq4CMsp8onOsdsdA,Serge N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It's definitely a spot best enjoyed after office hours. Until 6:00PM the restaurant/café is raided by hundreds of local office workers in need for a caffeine fix. Great value, super nice owners (I met Gabriel and Julien). My favourite spot in the area."
/user_details?userid=LXREICP9Lcb5HmhOaWEYeg,Hannah D.,"Wilmington, DE",5 star rating,"Monopole is absolutely wonderful. The food is fresh and delicious, the wine selection is great, and the staff is incredibly friendly. My husband and I sat across from the kitchen and had a wonderful conversation with the chefs, which was a very nice addition to our experience.We stopped in for lunch and had just a few small plates paired with delicious wines and could not be more pleased with our experience. I would highly recommend Monopole to anyone looking for an overall, wonderful experience."
/user_details?userid=pq8hKpl-FSbTihJJWx0UQw,Lily L.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,This is the place that your veggie hating baby will eat veggies dishes they create. super friendly staff and all the dishes we had were good.
/user_details?userid=6PBCFf-JFwYFoQ-YE-ow6w,Martin A.,"Berkeley, CA",5 star rating,"Fantastic food, friendly peeps, excellent coffee, good vibes and atmosphere. I've only visited for lunch and coffee but this is hands down the best cafe in the vicinity. Thank God it opened because I was getting tired handing over my hard earned pesos for mediocre food at Bonne Souppe. I am a really picky client but no bone to pick here ;)"
/user_details?userid=siynD6I9oRPOhDajq1I8tg,Mari C.,"Kilmeena, Republic of Ireland",5 star rating,Beautiful cafe. The staff are extremely friendly. The food is fresh. Creative dishes. Well prepared. Good wine list. Great coffee. Highly recommended.
