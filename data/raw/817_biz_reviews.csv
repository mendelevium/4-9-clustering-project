We have reserved this restaurant for a big group, their menu was interesting and BYOB is always great when you're celebrating a birthday.The positive point is that the owner was very nice and friendly. The bad points were that he didn't let us choose from the menu and prepared his own without informing us of the choices or prices. Â It was just him in the restaurant cooking for 17+ people and other guests. The wait was quite long and even when you are in a group of friends, we did not get to eat until much later. Again when the owner is the cook and the server for the whole restaurant, it's normal it would take time. After dinner, we were given salads and couscous with different types of meat, he calculated his own price and to be honest it wasn't cheap. I felt that he just came up with $40 per person before tip because that is quite pricey for couple of salads that we have shared and 2 or 3 big plates of couscous to share between a large group. In the end I've paid for the birthday person (even though the owner mentioned that birthday person eats free) and with the tip it cost me almost $100 for 2 people. I personally feel like we should have been informed of this before and the price was overcharged. As much as I liked the owner, I'm afraid I won't be back."
