But when I tasted the food....I mean I would sit anywhere to eat them. It has been more than 2 years that any western food could've surprised me.I must take my mom to go back here"
/user_details?userid=xSb2qnoa2BxPZZFS9XR3qg,Valérie P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The restaurant was highly recommended by a friend. Owners are two sisters aged 22 and 23, which in itself is very impressive. They both serve at the restaurant too. The service was amazing throughout, they came by very often to ask how everything was.Cocktails are well balanced and original. My boyfriend had the whisky and rhubarb one, strong and tasty. My was with mezcal and hot pepper, which is an interesting mix.Only limited choice of wine by the glass, but good choices nonetheless. I tried 2 organic raw wines and they paired very well with the food.My favourite plate was the beer carpaccio with foie gras, very generous portion.My second favourite was the ray fin, it was my first time and the meat was tender and soft, not chewy at all. My only complaint is too many capers on the plate.The octopus was served differently than in most restaurants, placed as a rose on the plate with rose pepper chips and ink sauce.The Faux-sotto (celeriac style risotto) with scallops was tasty, but too buttery to my taste.Prices are not cheap but you can taste the quality ingredients."

On a Friday night with no reservations because we were just coming in town we got seated and warmly greeted by our server ThomasWe had a signature cocktail which was great and all of our dishes were tasty from the carrots to the duck, Brussels sprouts and truffle friesThe chef/owner made his way over to greet us as well. Great dinner out in Miontreal"
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I would suggest reserving online because the place it's self isn't that big and last night it was packed a la max.They're closed Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and open at 6 the rest of the nights.They have a lot of funky drinks to pick from but not that many beers as I was hoping to see. They have one drink called verdun luv that I must try :) !Menu is only in french but it's pretty straight forward so if you need help just ask.The food is crazy they have really great flavours and the way it's presented is very beautiful.Very dark in here so good luck with pics my yelpers :)"
/user_details?userid=lyY3aOmISGFcfXQhPusyGA,Maude C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Friendly and trendy setting for some delicious seasonal eats in Verdun. A little on the pricey side but definitively worth it for a night out. The menu includes unique cocktails and private wine imports. For food, a mix of hot and cold dishes recommended to order for sharing. We ordered 5 dishes for 3 people, which left us with a little bit of room for a tasty dessert! Great spot!"
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Seeing the number of restaurants that have popped up in Verdun lately, I was intrigued by Pigor's french bistro menu and seeing how this place was always busy in the evenings, I booked supper for an evening out with a group of friends. Firstly, being a wine drinker, their wine list of private imports was great and also offered an interesting array of natural wines but I decided to stick to the cocktail list seeing the interesting ingredients and mixes offered; the Verdun Luv cocktail was my top choice and went down like water! The food, offered as cold or hot plates, were all very well executed, nicely presented and just plain yum; you must try the sea bream carpaccio and the spinach risotto, both were delicious! The service was good although we did loose our waitress for a while once the restaurant got really busy, but nothing to ruin the great and fun vibe of this great new addition to the Wellington strip!"
/user_details?userid=Y6JhHLPzBZ6Z5cHS1s-B4w,Rojarra T.,"Lachine, Canada",5 star rating,"Easily one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal! Be forewarned, if you're looking for large portions for cheap, this is not the place - carry on smartly and look elsewhere. Now that that's out of the way, if you're a foodie that appreciates not just a delicious meal but also, creativity, presentation and top notch service, this is your place! Between two people, we got 2 appetizers, a main for two and dessert; this amount was perfect. My friend and I were satisfied but not overstuffed. The grilled Octopus was the best that I've ever had in my life (picture attached)! The Shrimp Risotto was delectable and perfectly flavoured (picture attached). The steak for two was tender, juicy and a blessing to eat (I didn't get a picture). For dessert, we got the deconstructed Key Lime Pie (I didn't get a picture). First of all, how does one even think to create such a dessert? Anyway, bless the creator's soul because it was amazing and to die for! Even the cocktails are creative. If you can pull of a Kombucha cocktail, I'm a fan for life!I 100% recommend this place and absolutely cannot wait to return!"

/user_details?userid=NDpDbLel51kGekwWhdhb9Q,Natasha R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Went here last week for dinner w some girlfriends. There were four of us and they sat us right in front of the door. So the entire evening we were chilly. The wait staff was very new (the owner said he was just hired that day) so we excused his not being familiar w the food or knowing much about wine. He looked very nervous!! But he got our order right. We shared a few plates family style as was recommended by the staff: tuna tataki, faux-sotto, roasted cauliflower and moureaux and some very expensive fries ($4 for tiny portion) All was ok but nothing stood out. If anything the cauliflower was a bit soggy and too spiced yet oddly lacked flavour and the maple jelly w tataki was not a good match for me (I prefer spicy tataki). The faux-sotto was the best. And the drinks were well made. Overall a moderate experience for a reasonable price.  Hopefully as the staff acclimatizes to working at a resto the service will be more professional. Definitely nice to see new restaurants in Verdun!"
/user_details?userid=rlfJaG-nwMMWWrvi692Cew,Jonathan C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Food was really good, but the portions are a bit small for the price. Unfortunately, we went on a busy night, it took over 2 hours for a 3 course meal. Service was good but when we made a reservation, we made a special request for a birthday, unfortunately, the server forgot about it. Worth a try!"
