We ordered two plates of dumplings to share and two salad. I like the shrimp one better because there was distinctive amount of ginger inside which I love very much. The salad is seaweed and black mushroom. They were pretty refreshing. There was a small market of Asian snacks, which looked very attractive to me. They also have raw or frozen dumplings to go. Raw one is the same price with cooked one but 25% more, which are three dumplings. If I am here for takeout, I will definitely grab the raw one and cook it home so it will be steaming hot."

They have a mushroom salad which is awesome. Love their sampler dumpling plate. Quick turnaround even at lunch. Hard to get to these days because of construction. Its seems popular with the locals and I understand why. Great option for uptown reasonably priced dumplings."
/user_details?userid=oGL9JE09OHEJMxpY4ma7tg,David P.,"Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"La Maison de Mademoiselle Dumpling really made a name for itself in the Rosemont district, being one of very few dumpling restaurant. The restaurant is very  busy at time with lines going to the front door and incessant calls for pick up orders.I've eaten there a few times and it does a pretty good job of filling my need for Chinese dumplings. The dumplings are freshly made at the window and cooked on order. You can also order frozen dumplings to cook them at home. The dumplings are fresh, well made - with the skin not too thick and the meat well seasoned  - and the sauces that accompany the dishes very well.One my recommendation  (and why I didn't give it 5 stars) is the very few choices of filling. It's competitor  will give you 20+ choices of fillings (porc, chicken, tofu, beef, shrimp) and one of my favorite, coriander porc, is not offered  there. Also their use of styrofoam take out boxes is a bit problematic. Overall a great place and a real gem in the neighborhood. Very few  seating place so come early."

/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"We were looking to eat a light, late Tuesday lunch after running some errands. My aunt suggested dumplings and this place popped up so we decided to give them a try. It's a small hole in the wall with two workers out front making dumplings fresh. Always impressed how fast and efficient they are. Cute that they have a couple tables outside on the sidewalk to sit at. Found out they're originally from Harbin (north east China) which is why they have some northern Chinese dishes on their menu. Similar but different. - Dumpling style Szechuan ($7.00 for 8) - the peanut sauce was slathered on a bit too much for our liking but there was a nice heat level and the dumplings were tasty. - Salade de nouilles fraiches (D14) ($9.50) - cold noodles but not what I'm normally accustomed to. Much thinner and comes with peanut sauce and some thinly sliced vegetables. Heat level was nicely subtle. - Poulet (D4) ($9.90 for 12) - chicken and coriander dumplings. You can opt for pan fried ($2.00 extra) or boiled; we chose the latter. Steep to be charging $2.00 just to get your dumplings fried. We agreed the wrapper was nicely done but the meat inside was minced too finely.Pretty decent and cheap but this dumpling spot is a 3.5 stars for me."
/user_details?userid=52p2iAxobpwrBAYBtBmWHg,Jane C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I heard about that place from the book ""300 raisons d'aimer Montréal"".I lived in MTL for a couple years but I didn't get the chance to try out this place until now. I loved the dumplings, the cucumber salad and black mushroom salad too! The only downside was that there wasn't much vegetarian friendly options! Or any ""seafood"" only dumplings! I guess that would've made it a 5 stars for me!Will go back for sure!"
/user_details?userid=LqywrHdM-H8gSdKtGrhBuw,Andre J.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,Excellent dumplings for a good price.You can tell that these are freshly made dumplings and you can see that as soon as you enter the restaurant with the employees working the dough.I ordered the mixed boiled dumplings (dégustation) and it didn't disappoint.Each one was very tasty and good. They certainly compare to any dumpling restaurant around.
/user_details?userid=qlTKwIgDYfD7TZKF866oAw,Chan A.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,We enjoy this little spot. It can get very busy and the restaurant is quite small but we have always been able to sit within reasonable wait time.We have tried all the variety of dumplings over time and they all offer a different flavor profile. I like the ones with shrimp and the veterian ones with chineese mushrooms. Also the seaweed salad is delicious.
/user_details?userid=PzAgovA77AFlQC6AaEgkUw,Charles D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I walked in la Maison de Mademoiselle Dumpling the day it opened. I usually opt for getting frozen dumplings (which is not on the menu) and is tax in. There's a dope little window that showcases a wrapping queen. (2 weeks ago, there were 2 wrapping queens given how popular this dumpling joint has become).When I do chose to eat in, they'll serve you unlimited hot tea. And I think some pickled dishes like they serve in Korean restaurants.There's also a few shelves with some goodies from Japan (and Pocky for sure).So good. Simple menu. Good tasting dumplings."
/user_details?userid=1JxVvMkDcFLQfupnsqWKKA,Jonathan L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Tried this place with some friends and weren't disappointed! We ordered a couple of the assortments (3 of of each of 4 kinds) and added an order of shrimp dumplings and 3 won ton soups. The dumplings were served with a peanut sauce and a vinegar-based sauce (soy-ginger type sauce often served with dumplings). Overall, the dumplings were good and fresh. They are prepared on site and can be ordered freshly cooked or frozen to-go. Since we didn't specify how we wanted them cooked, we got one sampler order steamed and one pan-fried. I believe you can get them deep fried for an extra charge.Also on the menu are salads: chinese mushroom salad, crushed cucumber, seaweed and bamboo shoot, and there is a small selection of Chinese pantry items in the shop.The only thing I wish was that we could identify which dumplings were which in the sampler since they all looked similar, however, they were super yummy so not a big deal. Happy to have this new addition on the Plaza and will definitely be back!"

/user_details?userid=3XUfABRnqKdQg8MO15AkAA,Myla M.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,Great food and atmosphere. This restaurant has a very warm and cozy feel to it. No matter what you get on the menu it'll be sure to be pack with flavor. If you are looking for a place to eat in Montreal this restaurant is a must.

Found them on yelp, drove over and parked my car and ordered 12 boiled dumplings! For 10$$$!! Also got it with spicy peanut butter sauce! I would just ask for more sauce next time!Do your self a favour and go there! You see three older ladies with traditions in their hands making fresh dumplings you will be eating in no time!"
/user_details?userid=UUEoTPl9Vj_459T1qhNUAA,Ana P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A lovely addition to the neighbourhood. A small business - pretty much a hole in the wall - offering honest food. Word of mouth is making it often have lines, so it says something."
