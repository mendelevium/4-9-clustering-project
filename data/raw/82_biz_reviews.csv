But it more than makes up for it in its homey charm and tasty yet bountiful food at a bargain basement price.For a laughably tiny $8 dollars, you get: - A soup of the day- A main dish consisting of a protein of your choice (fish, pork, chicken or beef meatball) with a side of steamed veggies, beans and rice- A soft drink of your choice - A dessert (sometimes a costco muffin or dad's oatmeal cookie).And all of this is offered to you by a charming man who is both front of house and back of house, so waiter, cook and cashier. Watching him juggle all this at the same time is quite impressive. He certainly always earns my $2 tip."

/user_details?userid=sv98So_okvtXpEfbGbciQA,Fadi A.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My colleague and I came here and we were very very pleased with the food and service. So it's $8, for an appetizer, dish and drink. We got full dish of fish, black beans, carrots and rice. My colleague had a salad and I had a chicken soup. In the end we had some coffee (you switch it for a soft drink).  The gentleman (I'm assuming is the proprietor and also the cook), was very sweet and made the experience very pleasant."

A choice of meat, rice, beans, salad, soup, drink AND dessert for only $8! Not only is it totally worth it but the food was absolutely delicious. I really feel like it's food cooked from grandma's heart. I would 1000% recommend and will be returning very soon. P.s. This is the only restaurant that I gave a 5 star right off the bat. Great value for delicious food will always win my heart and keep me coming back"
/user_details?userid=d_uSfozaAZR4OpDNa8IiZQ,Dy M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This is a hidden gem of the city! I think not a lot of people would come in, the outside makes the place look like it has seen better days. The decor inside was not the fanciest however the food and ambiance reminded me of home. As we walked into the restaurant, the owner greeted us and proceed with retrieving soup for our meal before we ordered! What a nice guy! For $8, you can't really go wrong with this all you can eat meal! I hope to come back soon and bring as many friends as possible! It's a home cooked meal outside with all the spices and tastiness of any classy restaurant!"
/user_details?userid=7u8Q7oSoDyWxl3gEOd-iRA,Lee C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this pace! The food is delicious and the portions are big! Guaranteed leftovers, which i always enjoy. The price can't be beat either. There's only a few options on the menu, but all sounded great (and the sausage I ordered as well as the chicken my dad ordered was very very good). I believe you can decide between a soup or salad, and then they bring the main entreé out. The staff is really nice and the atmosphere is very homey. It's definitely not fancy but it has its own charm! I will definitely be back."
/user_details?userid=-rTE4ReobFVa9810EDIsPA,Home E.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Best lunch deal in Montreal. Homey, welcoming, delicious. 2:30pm closing time except Saturday nights. Best to call ahead to see if they're open for dinner. As in most Latin American countries there is a soup of the day, a limited selection of entrees and coffee or tea, all for Vegetable soup had fresh corn. Mains were meatballs or chicken breast in a tangy peanut sauce with seasoned carrots, lots of rice and black beans. Huge plate. All for $8. Support this place, please. It's amazing."
/user_details?userid=bBpESkJdwW5kVEgm8DErEQ,Bruno C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Go to lunch!Nothing fancy here, just great Peruvian cooking at a ridiculous price! Service is friendly and if you want to talk about the sights to see in Peru, boy! Does the owner ever have some stories!Everything tastes like it was made at home by a caring mother (or father). The fish is out of this world.Like I said, nothing fancy, the decor is simple, almost bleak, but everything else is so awesome, you won't even notice after a while."
/user_details?userid=dNIxs3_qcAuF8S9kS9iFCQ,Rafaella A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Reviewers are confusing authentic with traditional. Puca puca does not make traditional dishes (at least in the Lunch hour, I know the menu changes at night) but offers meals seasoned and cooked the way food would be made in Peruvian homes. The dish always contains some sort of meat, a good white rice portion (5 stars for that!) and some veggies. With this dish, you get also a soup for entrée, a dessert and a drink, all for 8 dollars tax included. This emulates a thing in Peru called ""menú"" which is a very low cost lunch combo with a few options for entrée and few options for main course, a drink and sometimes depending on the price, dessert or not (and it's usually sold from 2$ to 5$).The owner is also cook, host and waiter, a very Latino thing, to run everything by yourself, and he's the nicest!"

/user_details?userid=--6kLBBsm0GPM9vIB2YBDw,Garen D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is one of the best kept secrets in the city. I had been driving by this place for the last 15 years and wondered about it.Food was great...not good but great.Everything is made from scratch.No menu, the one man show/owner gives a choice of 3 different meats as a daily special.After that, your in and out in 25 minutes for $10.00 or less including tip.If you're not picky about the decor as the inside hasn't been renovated in decades, it is a great place for lunch."

/user_details?userid=TX5u3tPS1BdfjO02K5rq8Q,Mark L.,"Charlotte, NC",5 star rating,"Great food ,great service and great experience.  Ciro,the owner was our host, chef and server.  It felt like we were dining at his home. He made us feel welcome and both quality and quantity were just right.  I will definitely eat there again."
/user_details?userid=Bd-gKIvJMkZGRnJPfbKD9A,Andrew M.,"Wellesley, MA",4 star rating,"We had a lovely two-and-a-half hour dinner here. The salad-dinner-dessert combo is only $15, and the salads were excellent. The main course choices are a bit limited, I guess, but I liked the skate a lot. The desserts were apple pie and coconut cake, don't know if those are traditional Peruvian desserts but I'm not complaining.The owner is very friendly and happy to tell the story behind the restaurant's name. But don't get him started talking about Alberto Fujimori."

For  lunch:  Meat (or fish) + rice + vegi+ soup+ desert + coffe for $8.  Can't beat that.  I love the owner as well.  He's totally awesome.
/user_details?userid=pTvR_xN-sWY5-jakTKw1ag,Lisa Q.,"West Chester, PA",5 star rating,"New neighbors of indeterminate origin recently moved in next door, and such luxuriously mouthwatering, deeply rich cooking smells issue forth from under their door every eve that I dream of befriending them so that at some point they will invite me over for a homecooked meal, slapping me on the back with gaiety and smiling benevolently as I exclaim with a shimmer of tears in my eyes, that I've never had anything as delicious as what they've cooked in the comfort of their home, just for me.Well, that will probably never happen because in my apartment complex no one ever acknowledges the existence of another unless there is a Problem.  However, this past Friday I got a scrumptious taste of what that reverie would feel like if made tangible at the Peruvian restaurant Pucapuca.  The square, austere dining salon at that time was relatively empty but immediately the owner (also waiter, maitre d' and cook...in fact I'm pretty sure he was the only one in the whole establishment) filled the place up with his warmth and kindly smiling eyes, immediately making us feel like his favored grandchirren.  When he described the prix-fixe menu though, we just about fell out of our seats: 15 CAD for a starter, entree, hot drink and dessert?? On a Friday night in Mile End in Montreal?? We quickly composed ourselves and took to scrutinizing the menu- for entrees, among us four we got dishes of quail, smothered pork chops, spicy beef stew, and stewed chicken in peanut sauce.  The salads and soups we ordered as starters were satisfying, homey and flavorful.  But the entrees.....! Tabarnak! Each plate came heaving with a non-fussy array of food, a scoop of stewed root veggies, a hill of aromatic rice, a mess of peas, and then the meat front and center.  Our table devolved into a chaotic tangle of forks and knives as we dived into our own and each others' dishes...every one was sublime.  The pork chop, smothered in a tomato and beer sauce, was especially wonderful; the best pork dish I've ever tasted in a restaurant.  Even though we were at breaking point after the dinner, we all wedged in a small slice of cake for dessert.All this, handled with genuine familial feeling from the delightful owner/chef/waiter... it was quite the dining experience.  I'm sad that my return trips back there will be broken up by months of time. If you live in or visit Montreal, you MUST go here!"
