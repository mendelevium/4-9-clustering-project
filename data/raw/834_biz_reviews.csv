The hospitality from the staffs was great and I felt very welcomed! Very friendly people.Tucked in a little corner lives one of the best salad I've ever had in a restaurant. The Artsakh salad was creamy and smoky - unexpectedly delicious. Their BBQ was definitely up there. Spices and charcoal, what is not to like?I definitely recommend this restaurant if you're in the neighborhood because Noah is among the best here. Due note that the hours posted online might not correspond to the actual opening hours of the restaurant so call beforehand."

Although the restaurant is small, the atmosphere is warm and cosy. Their food was delicious and I really like the presentation with the BBQ. Later that night, the DJ came and played bunch of Russian music which brought back the memories of going to Russian weddings when I was a child. The experience was definitely something to remember!"

Although the salads were tasty, the BBQ was really juicy and just melted in your mouth. You need to try the lamb and filet mignon brochettes, you won't regret it. The staff is also very friendly and accommodating and the place is pretty quiet if you come early for dinner. However, later in the evening, there's a live DJ to lighten up the mood. We had a very good time here."
