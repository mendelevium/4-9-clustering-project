The food is packed with flavour, the staff extremely helpful and friendly and the vibe relaxed yet upscale without being pretentious. Perfect for a night out with friends, lunch meeting or date night. TBH Montr√©al doesn't have a big selection of Thai restaurants and many seem to fall short on flavour. Luckily there's Phayathai. Ever since discovering this hidden gem, we've been coming back to try different dishes. We tend to go with the owner/waiter's recommendations, which haven't let us down so far! My personal favorites have been: the eggplant with beef, the peanut sauce chicken and the sizzling seafood platter. Love this place, and can't wait to go back!"
/user_details?userid=9P8-9EUP-aEnuisqUYt5jQ,Kathy S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Covid takeout process: we ordered over the phone and were told it would be ready in 20 mins. We arrived at 20 mins and the food was ready to pick up. They have indoor dining as well.I had a Thai craving and this satisfied it perfectly. The green curry was so spicy and satisfying. However, please note, there is definitely FISH SAUCE in every dish. Yes, duh, it's Thai food.. but I just want to warn you guys. I saved the leftovers for the next day and the fish sauce was definitely noticeable. So, yep, this is as authentic as it gets so be prepared for the real deal (including fish sauce). Another minor thing was some of the beef in the beef noodles dish (pad see eaw) was ever so slightly red inside. It's steak so, again, I'm probably pointing out something that is not a big deal. I still ate it and was fine the next day!"

Ordered Vegetarian Pad thai and Vegetarian Penang curry. Curry does not come with side of rice , so ordered that separately. The flavors for both the entrees were very authentic. Reasonably priced. They do not accept Amex card and if you pay by cash they give some discount (I believe 15%). Reservations recommended."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The food is pretty good. We had the shrimp pad thai, the red curry chicken as well as the shrimp & eggplant. Everything tasted great, but it couldve been much spicier (especially for a thai restaurant). Their dish are around 18-20$ each and the portions aren't very big. I wasn't very full at the end but I was satisfied. As for the service, it was ok, nothing impressive. The food didn't take a very long time to be served and the waiter filled our water several times without asking. The place is small so make sure you reserve before going!"

We came to Phayathai based on the reviews on yelp. Very nice restaurant, the people are so welcoming and the food is authentic. We started with the papaya salad which had a very nice spice to it. We also ordered the phad sam sa hay, kari kai and the tofu phad kha pao. Everything was delicious and perfectly spicy. I will definitely be back any time I'm in Montreal."

Never been to a fancy Thai restaurant so this was a treat!i got the red chicken curry with a side of rice noodles (there's also steamed rice or sticky rice) and I just poured it right in. The curry was delicious probably one of the best I ever had and it was full of chicken, bamboo shoots and all kinds of veggies! I almost drank all of the curry sauce in the end. Awesome place!"

It's a bit pricey compared to other places but their food is actually amazing. My favourite is their spicy eggplant curry - must try! Great service as well. We didn't have a reservation and had called just 10 minutes before they closed. The lady was really nice and saved a table for us, as we were just a few minutes of walk away. Definitely, going back!"
/user_details?userid=dmprdDTSUebCPeTBGFxu5Q,Patrick E.,"Peoria, IL",4 star rating,"The dishes were delicious and crafted with great care. This Thai restaurant definitely delivered in flavor and excellent service. Papaya salad had a nice crunchy spicy sour taste. The Thai iced teas were just the right amount of sweet but the tea taste still came through. The chicken tom yum was full of tasty ingriedients although the size was a bit small. The pad kee mow was also good flavor-wise but they chose to make it with a thinner noodle which was an odd choice for a traditionally wider noodle dish. Lastly, the neur nor my had an excellent light curry taste. The bamboo and the beef were extra tender and absorbed the flavor well. I would highly recommend this Thai place for lunch."
/user_details?userid=0Se8OFrPpi6wE2TY2IVTLA,Eric N.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"A very unpleasant, disappointing experience. To start off, there was a long wait time for the food to be served. On top of that, the chicken wings are not fully cooked(see picture). Then there's the quality of the food, I'm sorry, I'm no Gordon Ramsay, but it taste worse than fast food. The crispy shrimp rolls has some weird oil taste, it taste like they haven't change the fried oil for a long time. Then there is the pad Thai, not sure if it's overcooked or what, but a good authentic pad thai shouldn't be that wet, the noodle is way too soft. For the price, the quality does not justify it."

Despite being late, they accommodated us without any issues and were very kind and attentive! The food was delicious! The portions were more than enough for two meals and we took some back to the place we were staying at and ended up eating it for breakfast! Even after re heating it the next day, the food was still delicious! I would definitely come back here on my next trip to Montreal!"

The place was full but we were able to get a table. BEST Thai food I have ever had, and we eat a fair bit of Thai food. Prices were reasonable, spicing was sublime and staff was lovely. We'll be back!"
/user_details?userid=voFxNdzhG-cDrW_9NzFGbw,Denzil D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ok, I had to update my initial review because my first visit was great but I ordered the wrong dishes and only when I returned with someone who knew what to order did I see how great this restaurant really is. I had the eggplant dish with shrimps and that dish is so good it is reason enough to come back again and again. The beef curry was spicy and exactly what you need to complement your eggplant. I had few other dishes as well, spicy wings and pad thai that were great. With the right menu choices your dinner can go from great to awesome, so trust the staff. They are friendly and helpful in picking dishes for your taste. I like spicy and this is now my favorite Thai I'm the city. Enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=TlSKUk9Jz-AY_gq5DTOZAg,Nik P.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a hidden little gem near to Guy metro and Concordia!Delicious food, a number of vegetarian options for those who need that. We had the coconut curry chicken and the peanut tofu dishes, both served with a delicious spicy soup. It is a small place, and somehow hides the finer dining experience it holds. I would not hesitate to recommend this place !They have a nice lunch menu, but do explore the regular menu you will not be disappointed."
/user_details?userid=rPIQiemmu6kX3WX7xUUJnQ,Ashley A.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This is authentic Thai food. We ordered the chicken in red curry and coconut milk and the frog legs with basil. The curry was excellent. My friend doesn't even like curry but agreed to try it and liked it. The frog legs were interesting.I also like their tea. It's different than the jasmine tea you get at Chinese restaurants and the green tea served at Japanese restaurants.Nice ambience too. The dining room is a small, cozy room on the first floor of an old Victorian house. On the spectrum of casual dining to fine dining, I wouldn't call this fine dining but it's as close to fine dining as Thai restaurants get."
/user_details?userid=l-1cva9rA8_ugLrtSdKAqA,Vibhor S.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"Ever since I moved here, I've been looking for Thai restaurants. Coming from Toronto, my bar was pretty high (as there's a bunch of good ones out there). Overall the food was pretty good. The panang curry, chicken with basil and chicken with eggplant all were delicious and had a nice spicy kick to them. The crispy noodles were not as flavourful, especially in comparison to the other food. The portions are good too, as the 4 dishes were more than enough for 4 people."
/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,Karen H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A Hidden Gem! Nothing from the outside will entice you to enter this restaurant but please do. Thai food is what they serve. It's small, clean and cozy. The lemon grass soup is tangy yet piquant that's why I have returned more than once. If you are a lover of peanut try the chicken in peanut sauce served with fried spinach.. satisfying! If you are opt to trying something a little more spicy, the chicken with basil will clear your sinuses. I had no complaints on the service. Prices are reasonable, food very appealing to the senses."
/user_details?userid=ndwFnGSRUQQMqPBifaxKnw,R H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Easily my favourite Thai restaurant in Montreal.This is a small restaurant. Therefore, reservations are a must, especially if you are more than 2 people. However, the quality of the food is always excellent. The Pad Thai is very tasty and has a rich flavour. Likewise, it's always nice to see a Thai restaurant that has real spicy sauce (and not just Sriracha).I've yet to find a dish at this restaurant that I didn't like! A bit pricey, but definitely worthwhile."

OK they do have white table clothe and is located in a nice historical old house but that's about all the pros they are getting from me. We went for lunch. Very nice service but slow, very slow. Took a long time to get our food. I guess us from NYC we are spoiled when it comes to more authentic Thai food ...???... This restaurant is in quality and authenticity not even close to quality Thai. Hugs"
/user_details?userid=hGJhZ6Z-sG5ux9yzZc406g,Juna S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It took a while for them to notice us and give us the menu at the beginning, but the service for food was rapid. They have large portions, we were two and ordered two starters and one main, and we barely finished them. We ordered Thai chicken wings and papaya salad which were pretty good, but unfortunately I ordered crispy fried noodle instead of pad Thai due to the misunderstanding of the menu,which only had some weird noodles and vegetables simply stir fried, not very tasty and special,and it's more expensive than pad Thai ! The ambience was cozy and graceful, prices are higher than other Thai cuisine, but I think it's worth it, at least for the wings and salad."

The food was average, nothing impressive.Service: Very attentive, and fastValue: Overpriced thai food, paying more for the fancy decor than the food.Ambiance: Quiet, very quiet, almost too quiet~ At least for us, but I guess it can be appealing for a business lunch."

Period, no discussion, no doubt! ¬†Was there yesterday for my birthday, like I've done for more times than I can remember. ¬†Food was absolutely excellent as was the service. ¬†Had a small issue with my yellow curry meal arriving after everyone else at the table received and ate their main course, but rather than ignore the late arrival, they explained fact that yellow curry takes more time s ou ne they essentially have to make it from scratch and just takes longer than most dishes. ¬†Then after explaining the whole service team and maitre D came to table with shots to apologize. ¬†On top of that the yellow curry was on the house. ¬†They knew it was not necessary since I understood fully and had no problem with the delay but they went out of their way to make it as pleasant an experience as possible. ¬†Tgere are very few restaurants left that back their food, service and quality to this extent. ¬†Thank you for a great night. ¬†Will be back many times more for the best thai food and service in montreal period."
/user_details?userid=YlQDJExT8gHHcXMiv9geQw,Lauren I.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"One of the best Thai restaurants I've been to. Although small and unassuming, the restaurant had an intimate, fine-dining setting with excellent service. The food tasted authentic and was simply delicious. For the best experience, dishes should be shared family-style, as they were around $20 and portions were generous. The pad thai noodles are a must have--they are well seasoned and textured, stir fried to perfection, and unlike any other pad thai I've tasted. The curries (red, green, panaeng) were all aromatic and delicious as well. I was impressed by the presentation of each dish..nothing about this place was sloppy! Had a great dinner experience here and would definitely go back again."
/user_details?userid=HmYj8wXXzzmc80DIenufuw,Sherry S.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Still the best Thai place in Montreal for me.

The spice level was great. ¬†If you ask for it to be hot then it comes hot! ¬† I found that many restaurants in Montreal had a much lower spice level. ¬†Even if you asked for it to be really kicking. These folks get it right. The only drawback is that it is more expensive than you'd expect. ¬† Maybe 20% more than other nicer Thai places. ¬†But if you aren't impacted by that then you'll be happy you went here."

/user_details?userid=WxjBeenvUKGCP2S5sI6_DA,Culinary S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This is a pleasant and unassuming restaurant that dares to stray away from the usual Thai menu and offer some unique dishes. ¬†The service is warm and kind, and if you engage them, eager to talk in detail about their food.Po Taek soup is a classic Thai seafood dish, and this was executed to perfection. The flavours were perfectly balanced, which can be hard to come by with this particular dish. The seafood was also quite generous in serving size and excellent in quality.We're huge fans of duck, and we'd never seen Larp Ped (Duck Lemongrass Salad) on a menu before. This lemongrass duck salad was a revelation, with a flavour profile that changed as you enjoyed the dishThe Kung Prik Sod, a ¬†chili shrimp dish, was inevitable as the soup made it clear that the quality of the shrimp was fantastic, large, firm and sweet.Kob Phad Kha Poa caught our eye immediately; we've never seen frog's legs on a Thai menu, and served with ""crispy basil""? We had to try it, and thank God we did! We love frog's legs, and these were the best we've ever had. Plump, meaty, juicy and flavour infused. Most notably however, was the crispy basil. These beautiful large basil leaves were carefully flash fried. We were so astounded at the texture and flavour we had to ask the server about them. He explained that they are carefully fried on a pan in a single layer, for no more than thirty seconds. Not only was it a trip to eat crispy basil, but the heat released the flavours normally locked in the leave's natural oil, making the taste unforgettable.Google our username to find our food blog :"

I got there early (soon after they opened for dinner), and I had no trouble getting served.

I put all my rice in the curry bowl because I didn't want to waste any of it lolThe pad thai was disappointing, the noodles were a bit hard in my opinion, and the chicken in it were too dry and hard.

/user_details?userid=v7VNHkElkp1sz50MJLidSQ,Chirag D.,"Philadelphia, PA",3 star rating,"Average Experience at Upscale PriceThe WaitWe went there for Dinner on a Friday night around 9 PM with no prior reservation. The place was packed, but they told us that there was a couple leaving and they would have a table ready for us in 15 mins. Despite the couple leaving about 10 mins after that, none of the wait staff cared to clean the tables, until we went inside and reminded them about it twice. During this period, someone that was smoking a cigarette outside (seemed like the owner) was going back in, and asked us if we were waiting for a table. He went inside, and started cleaning the table himself, and set-up the new table. We were finally seated after 30 mins. There was also a lingering smell of cigarette smoke around our table.The PlaceIt is a small place with space for about 35-40 people max. The d√©cor is semi-modern, but the place seems a bit cramped up. There is a small make-shift bar, where they would mix drinks if someone ordered a cocktail.The FoodWe ordered Fried Tofu for appetizer, Green curry with vegetables & Vegetable Fried Rice. Fried tofu was very bland (pretty standard). The green curry and fried rice were tasty, but only average at the best. The service was terribly slow, and everyone around food took a while to come, not just for us, but for almost everyone there.The CheckWe had a glass of wine, a beer, one small appetizer, one curry, and fried rice. The total check was around $85 + gratuity, which is pretty expensive for an average Thai RestaurantSince we are not from the area, it is highly unlikely that we would ever return to this place. Beware - If you are trying to go for a night out after dinner, and are the kind that is bothered by the smell of your clothes after dinner, this is not the place for you. Your clothes are definitely going to smell like food after a visit to this place."

/user_details?userid=RlHbVsMa-T-OWPirAkhcAA,Diena M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've eaten at a fancy restaurant in the middle east, that flies in chefs on rotation from Thailand to cook in their Thai restaurant, so I would think that the food was authentic and delicious... So I have a pretty good baseline to judge Thai food. I'm pretty sure that Phayathai has one of the best pad thai I've tried in the city, it's more on the saucy side which I also like, and we also ordered a spicy peanut sauce chicken - it was soooooo good. I can't wait to try the Green curry next time and compare it to the restaurant in the middle east as well as compare it to Bangkok Garden in Toronto. 4 instead of 5 stars, because it's a touch pricey but it is a white table cloth type of place and super clean - I still want to find a cheap tasty thai place for regular day cravings*** I've now been here maybe 5-6 times. We always get the pad Thai - it's always incredible. The green curry is delicious (but I always ask to remove the green peppers, and add bamboo, because they only put bamboo in their red curry, but I like it in my green curry). The chicken panang curry is also a favourite, and the red curry chicken is very tasty as well. You simply can't go wrong eating here, it's not only the best tasting Thai food I've found in this city (and I've been actively searching), but it's clean and I really enjoy the people working here."
/user_details?userid=WYU7YDh9u7tr__XGRwj3ZQ,Gillian T.,"Verdun, Canada",3 star rating,"I'm not an expert on Thai food but everything I tasted was good. For appetizers, we had a shrimp tom yum, which was listed as 2 chilis on the spicy scale, and was nicely perfumed as well; spring rolls, imperial rolls, (which I didn't taste but which my dining companions enjoyed very much); a papaya salad that was quite spicy; and a salad of beef sauteed with chilis that was nice and tender.Mains were a red curry of pork and bamboo shoots; a green curry loaded with fish, squid and shrimp as well as zucchini and Thai eggplant; noodles with chicken and basil; and bbq crispy duck. I expected the green curry to be hotter than the red but they were about the same. I was disappointed with the noodles as I couldn't seem to locate the meat in it. The duck, on the other hand, was wonderfully crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside. The sauce complemented it nicely without overpowering it.We had green tea icecream and mango icecream for dessert. It was the usual fare - nothing to write home about. However, the banana fritters were light and crispy, which is rare.The decor is classy and discreet, and the staff were friendly and helpful. It was not cheap though at $150 (inc tax, sans tip), considering we drank tea. I enjoyed my food quite a lot but wouldn't rave about it."

The soups were honestly the highlight of the night. My boyfriend had an amazing shrimp mushroom coconut soup while I had a superb shrimp tom yum soup. It was really rich in flavor. For the main, I ordered mushrooms with thai basil and boy, was it super spicy. ¬†This dish had 3 chili pepper signs next to it on the menu, but I think it actually tasted like 4 chili peppers. But I like spicy food so I didn't mind. My friend had a brown curry called panang with tofu. That was really good too. My boyfriend and his friend both ordered the shrimp pad thai which was both disappointing surprisingly. My bf said the sauce overpowered everything while his friend seemed to like it.

I visited along with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday, and we had a great time! I wouldn't be ready to admit that the food here is mind blowing, but I definitely liked the ambiance. I tried the Chicken Pad See Eaw, which met my expectations but did not impress me in any kind of way. However, I tasted some of my friend's dishes and found them quite delicious! My conclusion? I might have chosen a dish that was too simple, and I will have to visit again to try some of their other dishes!"
/user_details?userid=G422ejyfziG2xOtqgyKDWg,Didier N.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I hadn't been to this restaurant in over 4 years. From what I remembered, it was one of the best Thai place in the city so I was looking forward to go back! In the end, it was overall a good meal but still a disappointment! I would say the food is still pretty good and flavorful in general. For appetizer, we had a duck salad which was a little bit sour. Too much lime and I didn't like the fact that it was minced duck. I would have much rather preferred sliced duck. We then had the pad thai (only 2 shrimps) and the chicken with peanut sauce with crispy spinach, both very good.Why 3 stars? First I thought the service was very slow. We were the only ones in the restaurant. I understand there was a big take out order but still! Second, the bill came to close to 60$ for 1 appetizer, 2 main dishes and 1 bowl of rice! ¬†I don't expect to pay this much for an Asian restaurant (beside sushi). I just think they've been taking advantage of their success in the last few years to raise their prices."

Crispy beef appetizer was a bit overdone (maybe cut the beef thinner?), but the flavor was outstanding. We ordered two entrees - green curry chicken and chicken with cashews and both were excellent. Skipped dessert."
/user_details?userid=v3ed3Qwo3cnMH7NtsnIomg,Roman J.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I came here expecting a similar experience as the Phayathai on laurier, which is exceptional. I ordered a small Tom Kha Kai soup (~$5) (chicken in coconut milk and lemongrass), the Paneang Chicken (~$17), and two sticky rice (~$7), the bill came out to $40 tax and tip included. This is a bit on the expensive side for one person, especially considering that the food was average for a proper Thai restaurant. When the soup came, it was mediocre at best. The broth used a lower quality diluted coconut milk. The texture of the chicken was off and tasted as if it had been microwaved. The Paneang Chicken and the sticky rice were average for a Thai restaurant, but not the same quality as I've come to expect and definitely not acceptable for the price. It turns out that there's been an owner change at this location about 3 years ago. I'll be heading to the laurier location for the full blissful experience next time."
