I've been here twice and was very pleased with the experience on both occasions. There's a lot to like on the menu, but one thing that stood out on this visit are the Arayes."

Made the mistake of going on a Saturday without a reservation and it was in January during as storm. The team graciously offered us takeout and the food was truly amazing."

/user_details?userid=vTsbejwscDEdA3Ao_aIQMg,Lawrie S.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Very cozy restaurant tucked into an almost semi-basement. It's not obviously but also not hard to miss. Be sure to make reservation before hand because it's a popular place and has seats not more than 30 people, it was full even when we were there on a Wednesday night. They somehow managed to fit a group of 12 people but I'm sure they made reservations in advance.The decor, the brick wall and the middle eastern music in the background makes this place very charming. The menu is traditional Lebanese food and all the meat is Halal. There are some vegetarian dishes but the menu is definitely meat heavy. For a table of 3 we ordered the Shish Taouk Chili, the kebab kash kash, the sojok and the garlic potatoes. All this was more than enough especially with the complimentary pita bread. I would order every dish again, they were really great! Also very good value, we each paid $20 with taxes and tip.My only comment is I wish the music was louder as the restaurant felt kind of quiet at times. All together a very good experience and looking forward to try more of their dishes next time!"
/user_details?userid=M7vDDzoPNQDN2FdTcwCq4A,Eric W.,"Hartford, CT",4 star rating,"In Montreal for work and seeking some good Mediterranean because, why not?  I already tried Boustan and it was delightful, but I wanted something slower paced and more elegant so I found this place. Here's how it went!Atmosphere/Appearance: Set right off of Rue Mackay is this place.  It's all street parking since it's downtown.  It's not quite hidden, but it's not screaming for your attention either.  It's a relatively small spot, so I highly recommend making reservations via Open Table in advance.  There's a bit of outdoor seating and a medium amount of space in the main dining room.  We were tucked in the very back corner of the restaurant right by the kitchen so we could see all the plates walking right by us. (It only made choosing something more difficult because everything looked so good.  Lol.) It was fairly busy so it wasn't too loud to where we couldn't hear each other talking so it was fine. I can't quite remember what the decor looked like so maybe it didn't stand out to me... then again I am doing this review more than 2 months after visiting. Oh well.Service: Chaymaa took excellent care of us.  We wanted for nothing and she was quick as well as efficient.Food: For my appetizer I started with the fattouche salad which is a mix of vegetables, seasoned with olive oil, pomegranate molasses and topped with fried pita bread.  It was very good and a light, fresh start to my meal.  For my entree I went with the heftiest thing they had (I keep doing that and it's probably why I'm 270 pounds now) the ""Mixed Grill"".  It's 5 skewers in total.  It's basically 1 of each other skewers they offer so you get a kafta (beef), kabob khash khash (mixed meats), shish taouk (grilled chicken), shish taouk chili (spicy grilled chicken) and filet mignon.  The skewers come nestled inside this pita bread that you pull back with 2 more slices of special pita bread on top.  It was A LOT of food and would've easily been enough on its own.  Everything was excellently prepared and tasted delicious.Value: All prices are in $CAD.  My salad was $9.00 and entree was $36.00.  That's not too-too bad, but it's not cheap either.  he whole experience was totally worth it though.In conclusion this place was pretty cool and worthy of its grand reputation.  I would absolutely come back.  It would be very difficult to stray away from that legendary mixed grill, but I'd give it a try.  Lol."

For four people, we had the dip sampler platter, the fattoush salad, the mixed grill (5 skewers) and garlic potatoes. My favorites were the hummus, the baba ghanoush, the potatoes, and I could have put the garlic sauce on anything and been happy. Food was excellent. Our server seemed a bit stressed out, so not overly friendly, but she got everything correct. Good value for lunch; I would go back."

/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,Karen H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This small cozy hole in the wall of a restaurant was delicious. We had no reservation so we had to sit outside on the terrace. No problem! The hostess was pleasant and brought our menus immediately. We ordered a plethora of mezze which all the flavours just woke up my taste buds. Fattouche salad , vines leaves, hummus and lamb, grilled pita with Kafka, fried Kinbbeh.and Halloum Meshweh. They all complemented each other. I'm going to express that Lebanese food is a top favourite for me. Take out is also available. Located in center of downtown on a street that people don't frequent but we decided to look. Found a Gem ... Finished the end of the evening with one of my favourites  and that's a Turkish coffee. A definite return.!"

/user_details?userid=5lT1GxGTIArrYbZGazAm-A,Ida K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The short version: outstanding service for a small casual spot like this, tasty homey food, cozy settings, and lovely dessert to convince you to come back soon!The longer version: service was fabulous; attentive, professional, friendly and helpful with food choices; certainly above and beyond a casual, small lunch spot in downtown. We got the kebab khash khash, the shish taouk and rice and salad for the side. Everything was great. I particularly enjoyed the rice. It was beautifully fragrant  and the texture was spot on. Kebab khash khash was a bit dry for my taste, but tasty regardless. The shish taouk was excellent and was complemented perfectly with the small serving of yogurt on the side. Overall excellent for a weekday lunch. We couldn't leave without trying the dessert and decided to get the kenafeh: grainy and crunchy fried  semolina on top, warm softened cheese underneath, all covered in a pleasantly sweet syrup. Not too sweet, not too hot, evenly fried, prepared  carefully and perfectly to make u plan the next visit soon!"

/user_details?userid=DWmmB2RqyZQ9J44jF8UUlg,Jamie G.,"Burlington, VT",5 star rating,"With no hyperbole, our experience at Garage Beirut was transcendent.Between the seven of us, we covered quite a bit of the menu. Everything we had was extraordinary, but there were a few standouts for me: the hummus (smoothy and creamy and unlike anything you'll find in a store), the moussaka'a, the grilled chicken with garlic sauce, fries with pomegranate molasses, and the sweet-lemony-bitter olives.And on top of that, the wait staff was among the best folks I've ever worked with. Friendly, thoughtful, conscientious of allergies. What an absolute joy.Thank you so much for such a wonderful evening. We'll be back whenever we're in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=XxBbmN0D74n1M_8Rc3RydA,Edward R.,"Monroe Township, NJ",4 star rating,"More ""Garden shed"" that ""Garage"" this literal hole in the wall produces some of the best Lebanese food I've tasted in a very long while.Centrally located just 1/2 a block off Saint Cath's on the deceptively quiet Rue Mackay, Garage Beirut is surrounded by a slew of ethnic restaurants ranging from Taiwanese to Jamaican and I've already booked marked some for future visits.Reservations are a must as the tiny whitewashed dining room with a open kitchen can only accommodate 25 diners with another 10 on the front patio. You make friends quickly not only because of the tight quarters but everyone seem to be enjoying their meal,each other's company and even the piped in Lebanese pop backed up by the joyous and on key kitchen staff. I love the vibe.The menu is short and focused, divided into Salads featuring the popular Fattouche and Tabbouleh.Cold and hot Mezzes with everything from Baba Gannouj,Hummus and Kibbeh Nayyeh to Moussaka and my new favorite Sojok.Traditional dishes and Charcoal grilled section held kababs, Shish Taouk, and even a Filet Mignon...hardly traditional but forgiven since the balance of the menu and what comes to the table is so authentic.We started with the Baba Ghannouj plated with Pomegranate and mint.  This was so creamy,smokey and savory with just that little background bite that the tahini and perhaps just a touch of fenugreek brings to the table,scooped up with a light, thin Lebanese pita used as our primary dining utensil is a excellent start.Next came the mixed pastries which had fillings of spinach and cheese,minced meats,melted cheese and an excellent Kibbeh.good but I thought a bit bland after enjoying our Baba Gannouj.Our next dish took us by surprise simply because the melding of all the bold flavors in it resulted in such a delicious and sublime dish.Sojok is charcoal grilled makanek sausages that is then sliced and lightly sauteed in a sauce of Pomegranate molasses,Lebanese 7 spice, olive oil and I believe I  just a hint of Harissa plated with sliced shallots and fresh parsley.The firm lamb/pork sausage resting in all it's spicy,complex and so satisfying juices sopped up with the pita with just a dab of baba ghannouj is a bite you'll remember long after you've departed Garage Beirut and Montreal.Our final entree was the very good Khash- Khash kabab which was a pair of grilled minced meats on a bed of grilled and spiced tomatoes, crisped pita strips,onions,parsley,7 spice and a serving of Hummus.Spicy with that deep smokey finish from the charcoal grill,the kabab cooled by the Hummus and bright crushed tomatoes scooped with our now replenished pita and we are DONE!......or are we?Dessert of a delightfully ""jiggly"" orange blossom flavored milk pudding swimming in a sweet sauce with a sprinkling of chopped pistachios is refreshing and entertaining at the same time but I would have much preferred the rose water flavored version Beirut is famous for and a wonderfully chewy sweet cheese tart in the same sauce, a thick,dark,rich Turkish coffee with just a hint of cardamom is the ideal end to a very satisfying meal.I really like this cozy little restaurant with it's delightful staff and great menu and can't wait to return but before I end.... The chairs... what's up with the chairs?The wooden armed chairs are of the type that tends to tightly hug and seemingly won't let go of the posteriors of shall we say? "" the rather wide of beam"" or ""broad of transom""...and several times during our meal I feared that more than one of our fellow diners would be taking one of these well worn chairs home with them.... Make a reservation, order the Sojok, have the Turkish coffee and beware of the chairs but please don't miss dining at Garage Beirut."

The service can be a little slow but that's onl because they don't have enough staff for all the people coming in and take out and etc. If you are a big group, make sure only one person communicates at a time or you will confuse themThat aside, everything we had was very good: the dip tasters, skewers, pastry assortments etc.Would definitely come back!"
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"Garage Beirut is a nondescript restaurant on Mackay street, where you have to go down a few steps to get inside. In the winter, you could easily pass this place by but in the summer, they have a cute little terrace. This type of place probably gets most of its clientele through word-of-mouth, which is actually how I heard about it. I've now been three times and keep bringing new people to try it each time I return!On the menu for vegetarians, we tried: hummus (delicious and a generous portion), the garlic potatoes (yummy), and the muhammara, which is a walnut and peppers based dip that is actually quite filling. These appetizers were served with pita bread. The only thing missing here I would say is a fatoush salad.On to the meat lovers! The three of us decided to share everything we ordered to try a larger variety. We got the trio of mezzes, which included cheese phyllo cigars, spinach fatayer, meat kibbe, and sambousa stuffed with meat. For our main, we ordered the grilled meats platter (meant for 2 people), and the garlic potatoes. This was also served with pita bread. The grilled meats included kebabs, filet mignon and perfectly grilled pieces of marinated chicken breast served with small amounts of hummus and garlic sauce.All of the meats were expertly grilled and worth the price. If it was just this amount of food, we would have still been hungry but because we were all eating from each others' plates, it was enough in the end. One of my friends ordered their Lebanese beer ""Almaza"" and I was pleasantly surprised! It was a light beer with barely any after taste.If you're not looking to be big spender, a quicker and cheaper option is a sandwich with one of the delicious meats - and sharing appetizers with it makes it tasty, filling and affordable (though it's by no means expensive)."
/user_details?userid=HPtNvEBZTZzD6XhNMSdWEA,Andrea A.,"Burlington, VT",4 star rating,"Great food from beginning to end. We tried the fatayer (spinach pastries), sojok (sausages), and the mixed grill. Everything was super deeply flavored and we kept drizzling everything with the small bottle of pomegranate molasses we were given. The grilled chicken was so tender and juicy, and we loved the garlic yogurt that came on the side. And the steak was scrumptious. The mix grill was a lot for two people to share - even two people who had been walking around Montreal all day - so we had a nice heap of leftovers to take with us. Service was quick and very friendly.Two small qualms. They didn't have a lot to choose from for drinks: 4 beers, a house red wine, soda, and juice. Also, it's a pretty small dining room, all tile and concrete, so it was pretty crowded and difficult to hear each other over the other guests.Be sure to call and make a reservation.Still very enjoyable and we're glad we went!"
/user_details?userid=--Nenfm4GBg6w2JsqKcT0g,Layal S.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing restaurant! The kibbeh nayyeh is the best I've tried in Montreal so far. It's a hop, skip and jump from Concordia University and from the Guy Concordia metro. Super convenient location! The restaurant itself is very tiny so definitely make a reservation in advance. The service was friendly and polite, we didn't have to wait long at all for our food.We enjoyed everything, and being a native Lebanese myself, I can confirm that the food was 100% authentic!! Really reminds me of home! I recommend it if you would like to try REAL Lebanese food (Boustan, Amir, and Basha are not!! Please try Garage Beirut to really appreciate Lebanese cuisine!)Will 10000% be back!"

There really is a difference in the taste from the typical (Bashas and Amirs) The charcoal brings the meat flavour to a whole new level. Decor is simple and there is a mix of students and young professionals that frequent this place. My wife and I each ordered a sandwich (one shish taouk and one Lamb) and fries. Both were great and the dark potato fries were delish!! We stopped in for a quick bite but other dishes we saw at other tables looked delicious also and we can't wait to go back.

The mouhammara was good but not great, and the halloumi was overcooked. The best dish was the fatteh but by the end of the meal, I wasn't even inspired enough to try their cheese knefeh so left without dessert.Portions are large but prices are a bit high - not too impressed overall but may come back to try their grilled meats and meat hummus (and knefeh). A-OK but didn't blow my socks off as I hoped!"

One server only, but she kept up very well, on her game. She knew all her food very well and had good recommendations. People around us looked happy and enjoying their food well. Great find.

I'm the biggest critic for middle eastern food cause I have had the best Lebanese food growing up. Garage Beirut does justice to the kebabs, shish taouk and tabouleh. This place is such a good find and I highly recommend everyone to go here for Lebanese food cravings. I was a bit upset about the hummus and pita bread not being fresh- but the rest of the food was absolutely on point. I would suggest not ordering the garlic potato as well because it was too charred. Overall loved the ambience, their special beer, the service and the labneh. Now, I must go to my master plan of being besties with the chef and learning everything he cooks"

I got the sheesh Taouk and a dip platter to share with my husband who also got the sheesh Taouk Spicy (not at all).  The chicken was so tender and tasty.  I would definitely recommend these dishes. I was lost in pita and dip heaven, dipping that pita in these delicious dips. The service was good, our server was a very humble guy. I think we had him overwhelmed him because we were a group of 8, and we all had our bills split between 4 couples (which we told him in advance). The cheque got a bit screwed up but we informed the waiter about the errors on the the cheque and he was happy we helped him sort it out.  This guy had a great attitude and was very genuine to us. He made great recommendations as well and I believe this was waiting all other tables as well. I totally recommend this restaurant!"

The platters started with your typical appetizer platters that included salad, cheese rolls, and baba ghanouj which were great.  One of my favorite appetizers I had here was their potatoes, as they seasoned them in a way that made it taste great!As for some of the main, meaty dishes, they were all solid choices and good.  The dishes were flavorful and not dry.  The chef made us a mixed grill platter and Lebanese meat platter with meats such as chicken and lamb and we were also given spicy sausages that were great.Overall, we all came in here unsure what we wanted to order and we let our meal be determined by the chef with no dietary restrictions.  The chef pulled through here and created a balanced meal that everyone enjoyed!  The restaurant is really small though but does have seating outside.  We were fortunate that it was not too busy when we went and they were able to combine most of their tables inside to accommodate our large party."
/user_details?userid=UF9C7dIsvItJe4TT7Quu7g,Jeannette W.,"Wick, United Kingdom",3 star rating,Maybe this rating is only because we tried the taster dip plate + the desserts. Thought the dips would really represent the place (should be bang on for a good middle eastern place)... but the grilled meats did smell good. Maybe i'll go again for another chance but I'd rather try other places.Gave it a 3 stars only because the service and ambience was decent + first time trying the kenafeh and it was enjoyable.

The mixed grill was delicious and a good amount for 2 people to share. The chicken was probably the best. Staff was friendly enough though the waiter did not smile even once! The decor is unique and the ambiance very intimate (i.e. tables are super close to each other). I'm on the fence about whether I would visit again."

There was mainly one waitress serving all the tables and she did a really good job--kudos to her. The service was excellent.We ordered: - Fattouche Salad: The salad was so so good. I don't know how else to describe it. It was refreshing and tasty with the fried pita bread.- Fatteh Hummus: The hummus was absolutely delicious. The waitress also gave us additional pita bread without any charge! My only issue with this dish is that the hummus was slightly watery. But since the taste was top notch, I can leave the texture of the hummus pass. - Shish Taouk skewers: The meat was very tender and the garlic sauce was delicious! - Assorted Pastry Plate: The dish was tasty but my only concern was that the portions were small. Not sure I would get this again if I come back to this restaurant. -  Mouhallabie (I believe it is spelled this way): This milk flan was really refreshing. All in all, highly recommend this place."

As you might have guessed, we filled the restaurant the second time. I find the food at Garage Beirut okay but definitely expensive for the amount that you receive. The service is nice but I think they'll have to speed up the time it takes to get your food and lower the price to attract ore clientele."
/user_details?userid=gOCsjjb8M6MAMDOWE3MYRg,Jenia A.,"Vaughan, Canada",5 star rating,"First dining experience in Montreal and it did not disappoint. We came around the dinner opening time at 5:15pm and we were the first ones there. Over the course of our meal another 3 tables became occupied and with good reason... This food is amazing! We ordered the Fattet Lahmen, Fatouche salad and Shish Taouk Chili. The  Fattet Lahmen was very rich in flavours and gave a sensory experience like no other. There are bursting pomegranate seeds, crunchy pita, buttery cashews, flavourful lamb, and chickpeas all bathed in a savoury yogurt-tahini. This dish was very sensual but somehow made me feel light at the same time. The Fatouche was also very good, another great mix of flavours between sweet, minty and sour. Finally, the Shish Taouk Chili (chili being kind of self explanatory for the flavour) was grilled to perfection! All in all a great experience, from the service to the food! The portions are appropriately sized if you can stop yourself from ordering more of this foody goodness and the price is fairly affordable as well."
/user_details?userid=VkvSWEwVmdTUea3U2aBnrA,Barbara C.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Some friends and I went to Garage Beirut last night.  We went because of all the positive reviews, here on Yelp.  I've known many Lebanese people in my life and I know lebanese food.  So I had some expectations.For starters, we took the Dip taster plate, which consisted of four different dips served with pita bread (hummus, muhammara, baba ghannouch and labneh).  The bowls were so small, they could fit in the palm of my hand.  The hummus and labneh were as expected: not bad, not over-the-top delicious, just ok.  The smoky flavor we usually expect in a baba ghannouch was totally missing.  The muhammara, though, was very good.We also ordered the assorted pastry plate.  When we saw it, we were shattered.  For 13$, the plate consisted of 8 very mini versions of those well known lebanese pastries filled with either meat, cheese or spinach.  No pine nuts in any of them.  Nothing to do with the real thing, that is at least 4 times larger.  We were very disappointed.Another starter we tried was the Sojok, dried sausages sauteed with pomegranate molasses.  For 12$, we received a very small portion of sausages.  Although there wasn't much, they were excellent.Finally, for the main course, we had the Shish Taouk Chili.  Eight small chicken pieces, served on a bed of broken pita pieces and a dash of garlic sauce.  Period.  No rice, no veggies, no salad, only those chicken pieces on a plate.  We felt robbed. The chicken was cooked to perfection, though.We ate on the terrace, so I can't say much about the interior, that I saw a couple of minutes when we first arrived.  Nothing impressive, but it didn't look super clean.Would we go back?  Certainly not.  We left almost as hungry as we were when we arrived."

They gave us as much pita as we wanted too. In general, everything was fantastic, they accommodated our large group perfectly, and adjusted to our vegetarian's needs as well. It was a good mix of meat and non-meat courses, and by the end, everyone felt stuffed. The communal feel of the meal was also fantastic, with 4 people sharing a large set of food If you are in downtown Montreal with a big group, definitely recommend calling ahead and booking here"

I ordered chilli kebab which is the same as normal kebab but with chilli sauce(I would recommend sticking with regular kebab because the chili sauce doesn't add too much flavour). I thought the dish will come with rice but we only got fries, not even salad. But the kebabs themselves are full of flavours and very delicious. Try it some time. But probably not coming back."

I've tried better in the past. For the main dish, we had Shish Taouk. Tough the meat is tender and good, the portion of the plate for the price are ridiculously small. Just some few Shish Taouk meat with some garlic sauce... no nothing else. And to top it up all, we had to wait between the entree (salad, hummus and baba ghanouj) and the Shish Taouk, close to 40 min. I want to specify that we were the only customers ordering at the time, all the others were paying or leaving. And the kitchen had about 4 people working there. Finally, I would not recommend!"

Food was mediocre.  I'm Lebanese and have had much better food than this here and in LA. I can't understand the reviews nor the number of people that came yesterday evening for dinner. They serve the smallest portions when you order kebabs they literally serve you 3 pieces of meat per skewer and you only get 2 and no side dishes unless you pay extra. Anything you order is extra and so expensive for what you are getting. My suggestion go to Baba in the mall or  Boustan. Cheaper and oh so much better in taste. And so satisfying!! However the servers were very nice as most people here in Montreal are as someone from LA it is so refreshing to be around kind people!! So loving Canada and it's fabulous people!!

They delivered a fantastic sampling of Lebanese food for a good price. Loved the attentive and friendly service. A place to put on your list when you visit Montreal.

/user_details?userid=RYRGUry6BUtBVzhwOhUhbg,Slimer E.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"Coming from Kebab heaven (close to Green Lanes, North London, UK), my kebab standards are very high. Unfortunately, Garage Beirut did not meet these high expectations. No availability of lamb on the menu, despite it being listed, was a disappointment - please update this! Portion size was fairly average to small, and the general quality, although tasty and fresh, did not create a party in my mouth. Staff were friendly, but the venue was a bit small. In summary, it somewhat fulfils my kebab craving, but did not knock it out of the park - my kebab odyssey in Montreal continues..."
/user_details?userid=F_N4NyoMJWzBYFspeYfH3A,Mike B.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,This is more of a sit-down restaurant than many of the other Lebanese places in Montreal.  It's very welcoming and comfortable (I'm not sure why people criticize for a 'lack of ambiance': it's got tons.Food ranges from pretty standard to excellent.  The hummus might be some of the best I've ever tasted.

/user_details?userid=5cRXwvp8PwMRUAxwGiiZhQ,Samy C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The appetizers were greatThe main course was copious and deliciousThe atmosphere was welcomingThe decoration was modern and elegantIs there an issue even worth mentioning with this restaurant? In regards to my personal experience, the only thing lacking was the service. It was slow and the waitresses made lots of mistakes. Of course, I'm not a god damn sociopath and I understand that mistakes happen. But was the attitude on top of that justified? I gently asked them if the food was ready and the waitress gave me an attitude and passive-aggressively reminded me that it was a full night. So? You're supposed to organize a restaurant in a way that you can pull through even during full nights. Don't blame the customers for wanting to eat at your place. Stalin didn't blame the workers of being too numerous when centrally planning the economy of the USSR!This minor rumpus aside, I enjoyed my night and definitely advise anyone to grab a bite at this place if you don't mind occasional fuck ups by waiters (hey, it can happen!)"

I was not disappointed. If felt like being in Lebanon. Of course it was not perfect (and no restaurant ever is): the tabouli was quite salty, the staff was short handed.

/user_details?userid=ct_FaVZtLhTL1TUOP3UdKA,Marie K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Went for dinner her before going to the movies last night. I'm fairly picky about Lebanese food because I grew up with it at home. So I was wary. Overall the food tasted good, but there were a few issues:I ordered the shish taouk sandwich. it was small. really skinny. A lot smaller than you would get at any other place. the chicken itself was good, but there was only chicken bread, and two or three pickles and garlic sauce in it. My order came with French fries which were lackluster. they were clearly frozen french fries mass bought.for the same amount of money you could get just as tasty food but with a LOT more food at Basha's or Sara's. I most likely will opt for those other options if I ever crave Lebanese."
/user_details?userid=REju4DPZDg2veRIKOClvSg,Tina C.,"Oceanside, CA",3 star rating,"After reading about Garage Beirut in the newspaper, I was very excited to try it out. I had the shish taouk (sandwich only, about $6.75) - it only contained chicken, sauce, and a pickle.  The ingredients were fresh and made to order. The chicken wasn't the 'sliced' type found in most shish taouk places, but rather strips or cubes.  It was tender and moist. I found that garlic sauce to be lacking some 'oumph', and a bit watery.  The sandwich was a bit small compared to what you'd get at most places, but overall was pretty good."

Staff: super friendly! ( there was only one girl there who apparently was also helping in the kitchen which made it hard for her to take care of the customers) however, she was friendly and I have to say it. I haf kafta and my friend had beef cubes. First we asked for lamb cubes, but the girl told us they don't have it. All good so far, eh? We also ordered Babaganoush which was ok. Finally after 30 min or so the food arrived! Cold!!!!!!!!!!! We wanted to tell the waitress/chef but she was not around. Even when we got in no one showed up for 5-6 min and in the end I went almost to the kitchen to get the menus! Anyways, the food arrived cold, mine was ok in terms of flavor a lil bland. However my friend's beef cubes were well seasoned and delicious. To be honest the food portion is so small that at first I thought its for a kid!!!! N it was 15$!!!!!! Finally after waiting so long again the girl came and asked us if we want a dessert. My friend ordered Baklava which she said they dont make it anymore, and I ordered Kanafa which the girl told me she has to go check if they still have it! It took her another 15 min!!! Finally we had kanafa, however I asked for a knife as it was so sticky, when she showed up with a knife I was done!!!!! My biggest complain about this place is the price!!! It cost us 50$ for 2 happy meals( seriously I'm still hungry writing this, and no I dont eat a lot!), a babaganoush and one kanafa!!!! Seriously there is something wrong!!!!! The thing is the food was really normal, nothing spectacular!!! Definitely not going back there again!!!!!"
