/user_details?userid=IjdJsFpsCx1P-8owC9HqSg,Xia M.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"I get the feeling that this may be a commercial spot but it's soooo good. They are doing something right because I'm enjoying a savory crepe- a dish I had ordered once or twice in the past just for novelty's sake. The crepe itself is slightly sweet, and makes for an interesting combination when paired with savory insides, Like the egg, brie and spinach combo I had. Note: you will be asked to tip before you even sit down to dine (maybe customary). And you will be drinking tap water out of an ikea cup, no straw unless you request otherwise"
/user_details?userid=aYxrwlLyfYDK4DsJXTSPIw,Cyn D.,"Edmonton, Canada",4 star rating,"Stopped here on a recent trip to Montreal. We were seated right near the front which was great because the crepes are made right there in the front window. It was fun to watch and I think it says something good when an establishment is so confident about their food preparation that they let customers watch. We had a ham and cheese crepe and a goat cheese, pesto, spinach and tomato crepe. They were hot, delicious, light as a feather and full of flavour. They are served with a side of fresh green salad. The dressing on my salad was an onion poppyseed dressing that was tangy and crunchy. I found it so good I asked if there was somewhere I could buy it. Service is fast and friendly. The coffee is hot and good and served in big bowl cups. The location is on a busy street with lots to see and do."

We spent 3 days in Quebec city eating crepes and this was the best one we've had! I ordered the hot chocolate and a grilled chicken panini. The hot chocolate was the best i've ever had too! So rich and creamy definitely would stop in again just to have a drink. The grilled chicken panini was eh, but the place is called a crepe cafe so can't blame them. Would totally recommend for hot chocolate and crepes!"

We came into Café CC and got our fill! The Apple Cinnamon crepe was delicious. We split one crepe and each got a drink (water, coffee, latte etc.)We sat by the window, enjoyed our crepe and were left full. it really was the perfect afternoon pick me up. Staff is nice and they bring the food right to your table."

Nothing exceptional, but not bad either. I ordered the strawberry/banana/nutella crepe. The presentation wasn't amazing, which is fine, but the fruit was not distributed logically in the crepe, so I had to maneuver it around if I wanted to eat it together."
/user_details?userid=TbpsLQpZsEy_x-uLfRVMfg,Nick B.,"Lincoln, NE",5 star rating,"We walked by this shop the previous day. They clearly have something good going with the crepe maker up front with an open window. Smelled delicious. Came back the next day for a late breakfast. The seating is super comfortable and ordering was easy. Crepes came out fast!We ordered egg and cheese crepes, mine included turkey in it. They were larger than expected and they tasted great!  Excellent savory crepes. The butter brown sugar crepe was a little disappointing. It lacked flavor overall and was a little overdone. Highly recommend this place for delicious savory crepes."
/user_details?userid=f7cRgwmTAVI1ogeEh75-KQ,Tori C.,"Charlotte, NC",2 star rating,"We ordered two cappuccinos, strawberries and cream crepes and brown sugar, cinnamon and butter crepes - after waiting for about 10 minutes for a server to talk to us. Five minutes after ordering we were given two cups of water. About ten minutes later one order of crepes came. Then a few minutes later the next order came. We had to remind our server about the coffee and then we received them after we finished eating. The crepes were underwhelming and the service was the worst I've had since being here. Won't be back, don't recommend"

/user_details?userid=ORYJbyEvaVSkZo_nheLjAw,Ira K.,"Bedford, VA",1 star rating,"I've traveled five continents in our world eating at thousands of restaurants and have never been so disrespected as a customer as I was at Cafe et Crepe in Montreal. As my family waited for the crepe ingredients to be delivered to the crepe maker which took 15 minutes , a loud screeching noise happened in the restaurant . So loud that we had to close our ears because it was painful to listen. After two to three minutes of this inconvenience , I asked one of the employees what was going on . Clearly at 6 30pm a worker  was fixing the floor behind the work counter and using a sander 2 fix some of the tiles on the floor. In  addition to the painful noise. the dust of the sander was totally unsanitary. the Sanding and debilitating noise stopped for 10 minutes after I complained .the crepes were finally made. This whole interchange caused much disruption with my family with two of them refusing to eat any food because of the upset of the dinner .. The noise then began again as we were eating .I went up to what seemed like the manager and complained vehemently  to stop the noise . He was apologetic and sorry as the noise  continued I  began to raise my voice at him  saying this is unacceptable... finally the noise abated. My family was so upset ...lost their appetite and we left. In most cities in the US , this restaurant would be closed down by the health department. The crepes were disappointing the experience was horrific. If you want to be abused you're welcome to frequent this restaurant. They have no business being in the business of serving customers food!"

They are pretty busy. However they are so friendly (that won my extra star here), shared a lot suggestions on where to go in Montreal. I would love to recommend this place as a breakfast stop."

/user_details?userid=gLtslt10VlEuwyG2yYJWRg,mar k.,"Newington, CT",2 star rating,"We had high expectations for this place but were a bit disappointed. It had a feeling of a fast food restaurant. The crepes themselves were ok to so-so, kind of lacked the wow factor that you would hope for from a restaurant with a name like this. The table was kind of dirty like they never bothered cleaning up after the last people left and a teenage/ college kid make the crepes in a weird location in front of the window kind of in corner of front of the restaurant. I would recommend finding a better cafe where they make amazing crepes because you will most likely be disappointed like we were."

The impoliteness and the political censorship from the stores has really ruined my day.
/user_details?userid=_OyjH4D0dxU3l3CX7bKtUQ,Jessica J.,"Miami, FL",4 star rating,I had the apple cinnamon crepe which was delicious. My husband had the smoked meat crepe and it did not disappoint. Great lattes - only thing to consider is they do not have skim milk or hot sauce.
/user_details?userid=OUOV2NNK-p30mo8fmG225Q,James B.,"Nashville, TN",4 star rating,We went for breakfast. I had the ham egg and cheese crepe and it was amazing how they cook the egg in with the crepe. My only knock is that I could not find ketchup. I need ketchup for my breakfast. Other than that is was a great way to start the day.
/user_details?userid=0-H9ASZU3JtiI5QNM1abbA,John O.,"Peabody, MA",4 star rating,"This was a nice little cafe on St Catherine's street. I made a quick pit stop on the last day I was in Montreal. The café latte was very good. I also got a breakfast sandwich on a croissant. Croissant was delicate, flaky,  and very good. The server was very pleasant, and the service was good. I'd recommend to anyone to stop in for a caffeine boost and quick rest before continuing on your day."

If you're going with more then one person I definitely recommend getting your own savory crepe and splitting a sweet one. They're just so delicous!

The savory crepe we got was filled with sliced turkey, spinach, and cheese, and it came with a tangy sauce on the side which was perfect. The sweet crepe with Nutella, strawberry, and banana was a great version of a classic combination."

The restaurant though is dirty. The coffee is terrible. Ok for a quick takeout but there are better options around for breakfast or lunch.
/user_details?userid=ao7Jt5QoBWO15lGdZH16Kw,Christina T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I went there for a snack after work. I ordered the crepe with strawberry, banana and nutella. The cost came at 7.99$. The lady at the cashier asked me to take a seat while they were making my crepe. Another lady brought me my crepe and I munched on them. It is pretty good. The quality of the crepe is the same as Paris crepe minus the overrated price. The place could use a little bit of renovation. Otherwise, it is a good place to hang out with coworkers or after work.I'm not a fan yet. Maybe on my next visit..."

/user_details?userid=D3ZwyOl-2IpfzO_41Nn4Zw,Amina K.,"Clifton, NJ",4 star rating,"So I just walking through the street, didn't even want to eat. I saw a couple , they were just standing at the front of a building and watching through the window. So I decided to check it out and sooner I got that they are watching at a girl making crapes. As a tourist I decided that I have to try those crapes, so in 2 minutes I was inside. Nobody was welcoming me , ahah, but anyways, I just took a seat, so the girl were staring at me very weird, then I got that I have to order and then I can sit. A guy who was taking my order was very friendly and made a cappuccino for me. Can't say that coffee was perfect , half of it was just a foam, so it was made very unprofessionally, but anyways, I got the crape and it was very good! Not the best one, but good! Nice place for spending 15 minutes for a crape."

We ordered creeps which were pretty good and came quickly. Fruit with Nutella, nothing crazy. The main menu didn't list the prices clearly, so that was a bit off putting at the cash register.

/user_details?userid=fEz-_-4kLRR5wZkT1QZeFw,Marie S.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",5 star rating,"This place was our staple when we visited Montreal. We tried the Ham and Cheese, Strawberry and Banana and Raspberry crepes on different occasions and loved all of them. The presentation was superb.They were also the only place that was willing to make iced tea for us. As Iced Tea is not common around Montreal (except in Starbucks), this shows their service is superb."

Run by Asians they have a crepe cart out the front and they make an excellent banana caramel crepe. All fresh fruit too. Very nice staff and brought my son an ice water without my asking. The latte was excellent. I want pretty stuffed but still considered one of their tasty looking sandwiches or a gelato but my son was keen to be on our way so no dice to that. Most definitely a place to return to. I'd been thinking of crepes before coming to Montreal and this place ended up not only being the perfect place to go but the highlight of the trip (next to the maple candy place)."

Also had the apple, spinach, Brie crepe. Both were delicious. It was the perfect thing to split between two people so we could have savory and sweet. Made a nice light lunch for us as we visited Jazz Fest. I had a Ricard's beer and my friend had a latte. We were both very happy with our meals!"

I was walking by on St Catherine's last night and saw a guy making crepes in a window. I thought to myself, this is a place to go for breakfast tomorrow and that's what I did today. For less than $11, I got a giant coffee and a huge spinach and egg crepe. I arrived at 8am and there were hardly any customers. I was surprised and then concerned but not for long. Service was fast and polite, and the crepe was perfect! I plan to come back tomorrow and try a crepe from their sweet menu-strawberries and dark chocolate. Mmm!"
/user_details?userid=A2bDh8Q1NxdqWfKBr6VRyg,Biz T.,"Livingston, NJ",3 star rating,"Probably not the best crepes I have had. In fact the one I ordered with Nutella and Bananas was pretty dry and tasteless. Just did not hit the spot. Primary reason - hardly and Nutella, making it very dry. Re pace was not too busy but enough people around.  Tables were empty but not clean.  Did not see any urgency from anyone to clean them either. Surprising very disappointing given that it's really hard to make a crepe distasteful."

Ordered the savory spinach, egg and cheese crepe and the sweet fraise, banana and Nutella crepe for dessert. The crepes were OK, they weren't anything spectacular. I'm not a huge fan of crepes so I wasn't expecting much. I think they were a bit overpriced, but that's expected at any crepe place to be honest. My cousin and I split both crepes and we were super full. I would recommend splitting a crepe (or two if you're super hungry) with someone (if you are dining with others)."
