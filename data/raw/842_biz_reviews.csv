/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A solid bar with some of the best and most reasonably priced wings in the city. It's a bit far from where I live in Place Des Arts but as an American who is use to really cheap wings I find most of the wing prices at bars in this city offensive. Next door pub is reasonable and their wings are tasty (and even cheaper on Sundays ). The only thing is I am a blue cheese person (not a ranch) and the blue cheese dressing they have is really mayonnaise-y and not so blue cheese-y.The other appetizers I've tried are also quite good. Jalapeno poppers, potato skins, calamari, sausage bites and cheese sticks are always good options. The piergoies are tasty (and you get a good sized portion) and the french dip sandwich is nice as well. Servers are always super friendly and service is quick. They also have a different special everyday. I think the last time I went there was a sangria special which was nice and not too too sweet."

I especially LOVE the jerk chicken wings - the taste is perfect jerk! The deep fried pickles are also a must!

/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Fun dark dingy underground bar.Came here Saturday night had a great time with old friends and my brother. Got a few shots and a few big beers which were cold and cheap $10.I didn't eat but everyone had wings and shepherds pie. Wings were small but they were good but only thing is they have to do all the same sauce. No half and half.Besides that great little vibe minus this group behind us asked us to be quiet because her 85 year old grandfather can't hear very well. I smiled and didn't open my mouth and let her know that they were inside a bar packed on Saturday night filled with people cheering for soccer.
/user_details?userid=w2c6Xzt-0ZKMDJ7DYsm9PQ,Elaine L.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Great place we stumbled upon as we arrived in Montreal! We arrived on a Tuesday evening and luckily found this place to be lively and open (while most restaurants were closed). They also have food deals on most days of the week, and on the Tuesday, they had a $2/each taco with the selection of fish, beef, chicken or veggie. The menu said that the tacos were $2 each with the purchase of a drink. However, when I asked our server, she told us that it doesn't apply and we could just order as many tacos as we wanted. So we ordered a few fish, beef and chicken tacos ($2/each on the Tuesday) and a glass of beer (Stella Artois, $7). Everything came really quickly, and was so delicious! I really enjoyed the fish tacos and found it super juicy and a tiny bit spicy which really gave a kick to it. The beef and chicken tacos were also really enjoyable, but when compared with the fish taco, it was just not as juicy as the fish taco was. We noticed that they also had some other weekly deals on the menu and the one I remember is that on Sundays, they have 0.39 chicken wings! Hoping to come here this upcoming Sunday while we watch the NBA finals! Additionally, they had really cool beer sizes. We got the cup of beer, but you can also get the ""Euro"" size (which is just like a huge cup of those german beer mugs), and lastly, there was also the pitcher choice. I just found it cute how they named the german beer mug size ""Euro"".  :) Our server was also super kind and patient with us. It was just a little loud in here so it was hard to have a conversation, but overall, it had great vibes and definitely would be returning here to maybe watch a game as the atmosphere is so fun and lively!"

Once my friends and I were seated we were told about the specials and were brought ice cold drinks within minutes, the menu has lots of items but very easy and simple to navigate.We ordered -3 pints of 50-3 pounds of Wings-Cheese bite-Deep fried pickles -Jalapeno poppers   Food review: The food was AMAZING!Wings were hot and the sauce was spot on taste, BBQ tasted like BBQCheese bites were the best! all of my friends (& myself) loved them the bestJalapeno poppers weren't too spicy but just perfect. Atmosphere: This vibes were perfect and because the place is kinda small it really brings a...I wanna say ""together"" feel to the place, the music isn't too loud and the lights are set for the perfect level for reading menus and getting to the washroom back and forth without any issue.Environment: This place was very clean and tidy for anyone looking at offense uncleanness you won't find anything wrong here, the smell from the kitchen is what you want to smell. Location: It's in a great location in Montreal and is just a stones throw from the nearest metro station, When I move to Montreal I hope to leave near this place because it's in such a perfect little spot. Overall: I love this place and I feel like I don't hand out perfect stars very often but I'm giving it to this place, I've been a few times now and have never had a bad experience. The TV's are perfect for watching Habs games and the beer was always cold and glass never empty, the staff really earns the tips at the end of the night. I love the specials on wings! don't ever change this! PLEASE!! It's good to visit a good pub with good food and good people, good hard working people.  I hope to return again soon Cheers!"

/user_details?userid=BWLYVyIV6RF1yp9q3-yBtg,Chris L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Me and my friends always go there on Fridays! The staff is friendly and understanding. The service is fast and professional. The atmosphere is great and there is an added bonus of an old gaming consol if you feel like playing a few rounds with your friends! During the summer there is a small terrace which makes it quaint and relaxing but the quality of service never changes when you're outdoors! The burgers are huge and the fries are my favorite thing to get! I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I pretty much live next door to Nextdoor Pub so it's great to have a good bar not far. I've been here a few times and even had brunch there once. I love that they have bottomless mimosas and Bloody Caesars! So worth it! I love boozy brunch! Usually I don't order food but the chicken wings are amazing! The meat easily falls of the bone and the sauce is tasty. I usually get their Bloody Caesars which are so flavourful! I love that they add pickle juice to it. And speaking of pickle juice this is where I had pickle back shots for the first time (i.e Jameson shots with a  pickle juice chaser)! That shot is so good if you like pickle juice and want to mask the strong taste of whiskey. I also get their double gin tonics which is good and strong. The staff is super friendly! I like that they have drink specials on most nights and also they have really cool parties. The place gets pretty packed and the vibe is very fun!It's always a good time at Nextdoor!

The burger I had was very good, well seasoned and I enjoyed the crust of the buns. The menu has the perfect amount of items to benefit the cooking efficiency and please the dinners. I liked the full customization of my burgers, which is a strong point in favour of this pub. A perfect place to have a beer n burger with friends around the table."

Arrived just before 10pm so our group was able to grab the last available table. The waitress was friendly and efficient. The mac n cheese and the sweet potato fries were delicious. This place's atmosphere was definitely alive and fun! A neighbourhood gem.This was in stark contrast with my first experience there last year, when we had a horrible experience food and service-wise at brunch! Lesson learned; go for late night food & drinks."
/user_details?userid=km3lnJeuDtQrtKxyU1Dwfg,Trevor T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here on a Friday night to celebrate an occasion with a couple friends, and one of them suggested Nextdoor. We arrived around 8pm, and it was packed, but it was a good kind of full. Nextdoor has nailed that nice, welcoming ""neighborhood pub"" kind of vibe, and it wasn't obnoxious or stressful. We all ordered beers, and a plate of wings (6 Montreal steak spice and 6 honey garlic). The wings were amazing, and they have a good variety of flavors. Our server was efficient, and came back occasionally to ask us how we were doing, despite how busy they were. It's really busy, but it has a great vibe and reasonable prices. If you're looking for that ""neighbourhood pub"", Nextdoor certainly delivers!"

I don't spend much time in this area, but it is nostalgic for me and some of my best friends are out here and I look forward to meeting them for pints at this classic, welcoming pub. I walked in at like 1:30pm on a Friday and it was just the right kind of full. Folks having friendly lunches with a beer or glass of wine, nice mix of ages and vibes in the clientele, the true in effable feeling of a neighbourhood public house that makes my wee heart happy. I sat at the bar and had a totally enjoyable pint and laugh with the staff. I ordered the pasta special since I was in a bit of a rush, and I think I'd order one of the classic pub dishes from their menu instead next time, it tasted a bit like I was eating something that had been invented to get through a weird collection of leftover ingredients. But I was also under the weather and my tastebuds were in weirdo mode, so that's not entirely on them. Still, I think a mac and cheese or chicken wings would be the better move next time. Looking forward to it! Also wanted to give a shoutout to the chalk artist who does all their menus - her work is all over the small bar and it's beautiful and neat and really adds to a feeling of being in a space that cares. Small thing but I loved it."

After a little rocky start for reasons out of everyone's control, the staff and management went above and beyond to fix a the issue. The staff has great personality, from the busboy busting out in song to apologize for the wait. (Is it too late now to say sorry..by BEIBER) as well as signing Adele, to the whole staff signing me happy birthday with cake. (Deep fried mars bar.. Mmmmmm) Just a really sweet experience.They have super yummy ceaser's and mimosa's. They are BOTH endless on Sundays and you can rotate back and forth!  They also have a good wing promotion on SundayThe bar itself is pretty tiny, but has good seating options as well as a good section for groups.

/user_details?userid=Fje3gO0B3izgiptEaG4yCg,Nomiko B.,"Burnaby, Canada",1 star rating,"I came here tonight with my sister and had the worst service. We waited for about half an hour and finally got seated. We ordered 6 different types of chicken wings and a pitcher of beer. As we started eating the chicken wings my sister found a long reddish blond hair( we both have black hair) stuck in between the honey garlic wings. Now, I generally let the waitress know of the situation and it usually gets solved right away professionally but not this time around...The waitress took off with the problem plate and told us that it might be one of waitresses hair...Hmmm I'm not sure that's a proper way to deal with a situation like that. She went to her colleague and started talking about us loud enough that we could hear over the music. Also, she brought us the replacement wings and just tossed it on the table without a single apology in sight! So we asked for our bill without eating any of the remaining wings including the replacement. The same waitress started arguing with my sister very loudly and asked us if we are complaining in order to get the food for free!!! Now, I don't think I'm gonna fight over a cheap chicken wings! On top of everything, she was asking us whether we wanted a free shot of drink out of the whole situation...so funny...My Montreal pub experience was not good at all. I would not recommend this place to anyone who likes a food that was made in a clean kitchen"
/user_details?userid=Sv1CXNDiqYuVutmgFH8sUw,Kyra P.,"Ottawa, Canada",1 star rating,"Very nice waitress, but the food is almost inedible. Wings aren't good, but I finished mine. Ordered two eggs over easy with bacon and white toast... one of my eggs was over cooked, which happens, but the potatoes are just gross to be frank. They look uncooked and wet. Bacon was fine, but not great quality. Toast was still bread.........Ordered a Caesar and it was quite good. Clearly this bar is a BAR for a reason. Definitely not restaurant first. Nice staff but very small quarters. Too bad!"

The $0.29 wings special on Sundays must be the best deal in town - coupled with $4 pints of house beer and I'm a happy frugal patron. There are a handful of wing flavours: stick with honey garlic and BBQ, the rest are salt assault. Nexthill, the house beer, is A-OK. Nachos are a huge portion.I'd say it's the crowd and small cozy hood feel that sets this pub appart from an otherwise ordinary bar serving commercial beer. The staff is super cool."

THIS is the place to satisfy your cravings. Every Sunday they offer chicken wings for 39 cents!!! Minimum of 6 wings per order/flavor. Me and my husband tried like 7 different flavors! From spicy hot to jerk chicken, dry steak rub, spicy BBQ and they even had a spicy general tao one..which was my favorite! There's a flavor for everyone's taste. They werent too small, had the right amount of sauce where it's finger licking good after each wings and on top of that they were slightly crispy. Service was amazing and they provide you with a metal bowl for the bones, wet towelettes and a big roll of paper towel that will save you when things get too messy."

A European feeling, sexy but comfortable setting had me and my girlfriend enjoy an intimate date, regardless of the very very high volume, still can talk. There was a large amount of people not there for food and just drinks, of which they seemed to have a large amount of hard alcohol, but we had beer. The beer menu is small, but the whole place is small so it's alright. And it's not low quality beer at all. In the summer it would be nice to enjoy outside. The server had a really great beard, which is always good. The food was alright, I had the tao wings.. didn't have a ton of flavour either way but the sauce was nice to dip in. Think it was blue cheese. The lady enjoyed a part of the poutine she ordered as the amount was absolutely massive. The kitchens open till 1 am as well, which is great. Would definitely go back. Only thing we didn't like was the behaviour of some other guests we saw being rude to the server. That just happens when you're located next to Westmount though, not the pubs fault."

You definitely do not go here to have a private conversation with someone. The staff seemed very in control despite the volume of people and came to our table 3 or 4 times before we were ready to order. I ordered some perogies... PEROGIES at a bar!! They were an awesome snack! They also have a cool looking selection of martinis I would someday like to try as well as a Deep Fried Mars Bar located in the dessert menu.... Very interesting and definitely different menu. If everything is as good as my perogies were I'm not surprised that this is a popular place and I will be back!"

The bartender, Stefano, is super nice and can make you some tasty martini according to your taste. Really, their martini are amazing! :)I never had any food except for their bottle cap jalapeño which consist of slice of jalapeño fried served with a ranch sauce, it's pretty epic.Every time I went, it was full which affected the wait time, it was sometime long but that's okay when you're in good company. Also, it's quite small but it's never feels too crowded and the decor is nice.Overall it's an amazing pub that I'll keep on going to when I want martini!"

I eaten some of the best mouthwatering wings from southern georgia to new york city to overseas. For the most part the wings at nextdoor pub & grill just suck. I was expecting wingporium (toronto) level wings at least and got dominoe's level chicken. The BBQ was nasty. I literally wiped off the sauce with a napkin. The honey garlic sauce was decent. It should be noted that these wings dont have their own flavor. Even though wings are tossed in sauce, the wings themselves should have it's own flavor. Once the sauce wears off, you realize you are eating unseasoned chicken. If I'm ever in Montreal again, I will definitely not come here."

We went to Nextdoor Pub on a rather uneventful Friday evening and we stumbled upon this small but insanely crowded bar. We got in after a few minutes and I kid you not it was so full I could have probably screamed the words in gibberish and people would not notice. We were thoroughly impressed by the variety of martini's they had, we ordered our sangria and a couple of appetizers. The staff was extremely friendly, they even apologized for the waiting line. I must say, that was te best red wine sangria I have had in Montreal (note: when it comes to sangria I have probably had mine and five other people's fair share) The appetizers were cooked fresh and they were way too good for regular bar finger food. The spicy sausages were good size portions and the jalepeno poppers were too tasty that we burnt the roof of our mouths in the process (once burnt, you just keep eating cause its sinful to stop with just one) I highly recommend this to everyone, even if it is slightly out of your way or there is a line. Loved the attitude of the staff and the drinks keep haunting me to come visit again soon"

If I lived in the neighbourhood, I'd be there more often, but as it is my friends and I metro down to NDG from the Plateau and Petite Patrie every week. If watching the big game is your thing, it's a great place for that too. I've been at Nextdoor a few times during playoffs games, and the atmosphere in the bar was almost as intense and exciting as it must have been in the Bell Centre. I love this place.

I had 3 spoons of chilli and could not finish the rest so it was returned to the kitchen. If food is returned because a customer can not eat it because it was drowning in salt, the customer should not be charged. No body likes to spend their money poorly or on poor quality food.

I really enjoyed it.We were served all night by the infamous Jerry, and as always he was great and never stopped smiling and I think I ended up drinking a bottle of gin by myself. We had a blast! He and the female bartender who was very nice and I think I hit on were a great duo and handled the surprisingly packed place efficiently! I look forward to going back next time I'm up there.

/user_details?userid=VFrmhr8LF4sp4uwpArsL_Q,Erick P.,"Rockville, MD",5 star rating,Was visiting in town for two weeks and was trying quite a few pubs/bars in the area and made my way to this place. The staff was very personable and very attentive. My second visit there I met Jay the bar manager and was hooked. I ended up going 3 times in the last week i was there. i ate a meal every time and was never let down. The chili that was recommended was amazing. The bar tenders were some of the best I have dealt with along with the atmosphere. Met great people every time I was there and met some people I plan to come back and visit. If you are in the area this is a great place to stop by.

This place was great all around. Service very well and friendly. Drinks were great and the ambience was alive and welcoming. Felt like a local instantly. The Christmas Devore and vibe truly set the night and saved our Christmas night outing. Highly recommended if you want good drinks and a good ambience for good prices.
