/user_details?userid=aIqDek9d1fDEgLIAWXMGSA,Robert L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5 star rating,what's great discovery. not only was the food amazing the price was even better. I fell off my chair when they gave me the bill as the portion was so big. I will be back for that pizza they give you at the beginning. the salad was as big as the table and I ate not even half of my meal which I rarely do. great experience. just be warned it's a small place and hard to find parking.
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",1 star rating,It hurts me to put one star on this but there wasn't that much variety in dishes and the restaurant is small. I was there for a party so maybe that's why our choices were limited but it was very expensive for what we got.
