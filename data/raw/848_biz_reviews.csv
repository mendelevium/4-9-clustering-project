Our usual orders are salted fish fried rice, quails, eggplant in hot pot... Everything tasty and served quickly! Now that we are in pandemic times, we ordered takeout and it was still delicious. This time trying their cambodian seafood noodle, pad thai and chicken curry dish!"
/user_details?userid=iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,David M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Wow, A real revelation that's been on my radar for some time. NB it is closed on Tuesdays :) as we once sadly found out.This place is packed despite being quite large, prepare to wait during the evening. Takeout is a good option.The nicely pictures menu, it is gigantic and leans heavily on beef and chicken. Going with people who've eaten there definitely helps.We got duck, chicken, beef, shrimp, mussels, and even a veggie dish. The selection is truly astounding.Quick breakdown of the meals, total with tax and tip is about $140 for 8 huge plates.Awesome ""crispity"" sesame beefMussels in Thai SauceWon Ton Soup with shrimpHong Kong noodles with beefDuck in Oyster SauceMorning Glory in garlic sauceGeneral Tao ChickenCrispy ChickenThe top 3 were my faves, I love General Tao but this one was not as crispy and missing the spicy kick to complement the sweet.The service is blazing fast, there's a huge waitstaff and lots of kitchen workers so not much chance to socialize as they're quite busy.Overall would definitely go back and can finally give a quick answer if someone asks me if there's any good Asian spots outside downtownA wonton soup was just a delightful way to start off, probably also the healthiest thing as well."

/user_details?userid=ame9YUi0LjCTBi9Gl87-ng,Odette E.,"Sanford, Orlando, FL",3 star rating,"This place is outside of Montreal. Super popular, so was excited to try. A bit divey and location not the greatest but. Food was  very good. Extensive menu.  We ordered Hong Kong noodles,  Chicken ginger,  Beef vegetables over crispy noodles,  and grilled chicken. Portions were a little off. Would like to have more chicken or beef instead of the extra large portions of rice. I think I got about 3 cups of rice with my chicken.  All very tasty. Another rhing..urgh..  Bring cash. They dont accept credit cards. If debit, it must be from a Canadian bank. Conveniently they have a cash machine which cost over 4 USD to get money out. Parking, good luck..it took me about 15 mins to find a spot nearby. That was painful."
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",5 star rating,Let me help share in words how amazing this place is. Chinese food is what I grew up on. It's in many cases my comfort food. My dads side of the family is Chinese. It was part of the regular rotation of meals in my household and one of the few foods we would go out to a restaurant to eat back in he day. In my opinion Wing Phat is exceptional. We would eat some good Chinese restaurants in Western Canada and WF is as good of not better than the best places I can remember from my youth. Yes folks... it's that good! The first time I came here was on a weekend night. The front waiting area was around 10-15 deep with people waiting for tables. This also with the restaurant being medium large in size. They can accommodate large tables of say 8 or ten people at a time and because of the sheer volume can crank out lots of dishes in quick efficient manner. Here's what I have sampled here so far:18- Imperial roll. Big in size but nothing special 3/525- Papaya salad (som tam)- spicy- 4.5 /5 lots of juicy dressing and great sweet/ tangy flavour26 Grilled beef salad- generous servings of beef and served up quite spicy per normal. 4/5142- Sesame beef- crispy and tender with that sweet sauce 5/5. Get in My mouth now. It's that delish55- Hong Kong noodles with beef. In a beefy soya sauce mix.4/556- hong Kong noodles with beef and Chinese broccoli. 5/5 I liked this a bit better than 55. Crunchy gai lan and the beef is super tender as always 48- crispy chicken- served dry with a bit of salt and sliced Chinese style. 3.5/5 not bad but I've had a bit better. Served with ubiquitous shrimp crackers 103- morning glory pan fried in garlic- 6/5. If all vegetables tasted this good maybe I should be a vegetarian! 118- Chicken Hamok (funny name en francais)- aka red curry chicken 7/5- so tender and that red curry sauce is on point with light heat. Also I love they don't skimp on chicken (like many other restaurants do) which I absolutely despise!  Their menu is hella gargantuan huge. It has photos of the dishes which I wonder why more places don't do this? Great idea!  I can't wait to come here to same more and more! *****One minor downside that annoys me slightly is you can't pay with CC. Can't collect those CC rewards folks! Cash or interact only.

Their selection is amazing. There are many dishes familiar to the locals but many more of them discoveries from overseas that are fantastic. Looking around while sitting gives you a healthy mix of different ethnicity enjoying their food experience.The first time I had the Sesame Beef was one of the best dishes I ever had. Their crispy chicken was amazing... simply decadent. Their morning glory veggie dish was a great foodie experience. We had a number of noodle dishes are they're all good. Nothing disappointed. Nothing. Excellent food, can't wait to go back with friends! Excellent for sharing. Menu has pictures, smart.Service was good but slow the first time we went around 7-9PM. Line-up was about 30 minutes as they were incredibly busy, the second time we hit it early and we didn't even wait and the food we got was real quick. I smiled when I left seeing the 50+ people waiting to sit down."

I come here pretty often with my boyfriend and we always order our go to favourite meals. The Phnom Penh soup and the Lok Lak with rice. The Phnom Penh is a soup with noodles, seafood and minced porc( I usually ask for no organs). The soup base taste extremely flavourful and savoury. The Lok Lak is a dish served with marinated beef bites and a sort of orange fried rice. It is delicious and is humongous. They are so generous with their food portions... The entire restaurant is super clean, and the staff is nice. I love how the prices on their menu already includes taxes. I would recommend to try this restaurant if you love authentic Asian food. Coming here is about 30 minutes drive for me, and every time I come to Wing Phat, it's definitely worth it!!"

/user_details?userid=Henrt3UXBgJAMaM_9szKiA,Kathy N.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"This restaurant is very family friendly and is perfect for sharing a warm, hearty meal. Wing Phat is a Vietnamese/Thai/Chinese restaurant that offers plenty of options from lobster to stir-fry vegetables. The best thing to order is the sour/spicy tofu soup. It's amazingly flavourful and is a huge portion which you can share with a group. Everything ordered from the crispy tofu to the stir-fry vegetables was absolutely perfect!  You're not going to get five-star quality service, but the staff is approachable and helpful. The service is quite fast so you won't have to wait too long for your food. It does get pretty crowded for lunch because it's a local favourite. A hidden gem, it's a little out of the way but definitely worth it. Take your family or friends here, they will definitely end up coming back time and time again."
/user_details?userid=Iu5mS8o02-RGpjJdxI0v7w,Harry K.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"Yep, I can confirm now these generous stars thrown at this place by others here is not an exaggerated thing, this place well deserves them, they've earned it. I'd marked this place a few months ago and today was the judgment day. We arrived around 7pm on a Sunday and the place was full, had to wait in line for about 15 minutes until seated. Good sign, good sign. We ordered Thai beef, large size Singapore noodles, General Tao, mixed vegetables with tofu and a medium bowl rice. Truly awesome, very delicious, professionally prepared dishes. 4 adults, we stuffed our faces and we had to ask for a doggy bag. The star dish was the Thai beef. I don't think I've ever had any Asian beef dish elsewhere with cotton like softness, melt in your mouth without the chewing struggle like a cat kinda beef. Mind blown :)Don't expect much decoration wise on the inside nor have second thoughts entering the place while on the outside like I had. It might not look all that trendy, chic and inviting but once you had a few bites of them splendid food, these thoughts just disappear in thin air. Food quality/taste over looks anytime for me. Don't get me wrong, bathroom and the rest in general are clean. Yip, I'm that type of dude who knocks stars off if bathroom is missing TLC and or hygiene in other areas is neglected.  It's a BYOW also. Try it, seriously do try it. You'll come back for more some other day, I'm sure."

The restaurant looks a little worn on the outside and does not have much curb appeal but I quickly got over that. Street parking was available as they do not have a parking lot. We went for dinner around 6:30. It was busy but we were seated quickly. The menu is huge. There are lots of Asian inspired dishes to pick from. We ordered spring rolls, shrimp wonton, General chicken with spicy fried rice and salt and pepper halibut. The food did not come out all at the same time but it was fast and hot. The taste of everything was very fresh and had great flavor. A tip: they don't take credit cards (why I gave them 4 stars), they take Canadian dollars, US dollars or you need to use their atm which had a crazy surcharge. If you pay with US dollars which we did be prepared to not get a very good exchange rate."

Big portions i got a small and I was so full by the end. We also got a plate of crispy sesame beef. I love that the plate was only beef thats it. I dont care for rice. 2 soups + big plate of beef, 32$ tax inc. Amazing.Cant wait to go back and try all the other things!"

I'm extremely picky when it comes to Asian food in general; as I try a lot of different restaurants. This place stands out. The food is flavourful, authentic and generously served. I always leave this restaurant more than satisfied. Also, for anyone who loves beef short ribs, the black pepper one is to die for. I'm just thinking about it now and I want to go back. I've never had anything quite like it. It may not be the healthiest option, but let me tell you, it's worth it!"
/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Decent asian food place, pricey though. Went there a few times with friends for dinner. Last time I went with 2 friends. First of all, this place has no parking spots but street parking can be found fairly easily. We went there on a weekday evening for dinner and were seated right away, with the most of the tables with customers already. As this place serves a mix of Cambodian, Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese food, I decided to go for the loc lac beef, which a meal consisting of cubes of beef accompanied with tomato sauce fried rice. The quantity was generous and the food itself was tasty. However, I did not feel that it was enough for the price that I paid. I do not think I will go back to this specific restaurant as the prices are a little too expensive for what they offer. Service however was quick and good."

Since i don't live in the area, i tend to come here on the weekend. It's always full! This time i came with my mom to have her try this place. She loved it!! We were lucky enough to get the last siu mai, a tender, juicy meatball nestled in a delicious broth. You usually order a fried beignet with it (i don't know what it's called but the picture is right next to the siu mai). I believe the owner(s) are cambodian but you get vietnamese, chinese, thai, cambodian food and trust me, it's all good! Did i mention that the menu is a ""photo"" menu? Yesss!

I ordered the Wing Phat Fried Rice (with added spice) - $8 and it was extremely delicious! They fried the rice right - each grain of rice is easily identified - not too much oil; and right amount of goodness. (meat, egg, vegetables). We also ordered the wonton soup which was a steal - $4.We also had Garlic Bak Choy which was super tasty! Very flavourful and portions were reasonable.Highly recommend this place - I will be back!"

The fried rice was ok. The soups were not worth reordering. Don't go here the menu options were what drew us in but they just didn't impress."

You won't have to wait very long for food to arrive.The Bad:-It's a bit expensive for what it is.-Our waitress wasn't the greatest/friendliest-We asked for Thai lobster. We were told that they don't have it...we needed to order regular lobster and needed to pay $4 extra to add Thai seasoning to it -The salt and pepper squid has thin shreds of squid surrounded by lots of batter.-Normally, when you order soup, it should be served first (before the other dishes)...in our case, it was the last course to arrive (never seen this before in any restaurant anywhere...Italian, Colombian, Mexican, French, Chinese, Thai etc. included).-I'm not sure if this is a milennial thing, as the entire staff is made up of college/university-aged workers, but I'll stick to my old-school Chinese restaurants where I can be guaranteed good food, good service, good prices, and my soup being served first (even if it doesn't come with the bells and whistles that this place offers).NO THANKS."
/user_details?userid=OJq7Zgl5BXKmeHXt46ywNQ,Guts B.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I have been to this place many times and have tried most of the dishes on the menu and noticed that the meat was always odd tasting and had a very powdery texture to it. I refrained from giving it a negative review the first few times thinking that maybe i was just unlucky and always went there on bad days. I ended up going back with a group of friends for someone's birthday a month later and we ordered a variety of dishes for the table to share. Among them were beef brocoli, ginger lobster and steemed tilapia. We asked the waitress if the seafood was fresh before ordering because we didn't notice aquariums with live seafood and she confirmed that all their seafood was fresh that they were just kept downstairs. We found it odd but decided to order seafood nonetheless. When our orders came we were all shocked at how small the lobsters were, like the poor things were caught before even reaching adulthood. We ate it anyway and it was one of the worst ginger lobsters i had ever eaten. It was overly sweet as if it was cooked in peanut butter and the taste of the ginger was non existant. The lobster meat was also very dry it felt like it was precooked the day before and then microwaved. We moved on and tackled the tilapia next and the meat was so bland everyone thought it tasted like a fish that was purchased frozen from a supermarket. By then everyone had lost their appetite and given up hope but we still forced ourselves to finish the beef brocoli. I was really curious to see if the beef was going to have that same powdery texture like meat that has been sitting in baking soda for too long to achieve tenderness and to my dismay it did! Something is just not right when the meat falls apart before you even begin to chew it. All in all im giving this place a one star because i don't believe they use fresh and quality ingredients and i will not be going back anytime soon"

/user_details?userid=oSXIHISg8qRXx1X6nn4cUA,Antonella C.,"Miami Beach, FL",5 star rating,"This place is incredible, and super tasty. This is actually really really good Chinese for the surprising location it's at. Another excellent perk is that everyone including the Asians on staff speak fluent English making it extremely easy to communicate any special requests needed. (and we all know I will have a few)Let me start by saying this place really has their S*** together !!! I went on a super duper ridiculously busy Saturday night.. (the type when you walk in and there's a line up practically out the door, but then again it's almost always like this because it's that good) and still the wait was only about 10-15 minutes because this place is decently large with a lot of seating.While I was waiting for a table, I asked the hostess what she suggested as vegan options (I had been there many times before as a vegetarian but first time as a vegan). She was very sweet and quickly suggested I start to take a look at the menu and walked me to talk to a manager on duty.The manager took some time to go over a few dishes with me and sauce options for my noodles, even though she was overwhelmingly busy. She basically said to choose any dish, substitute any meat for sautéed tofu instead and that they would be able to make almost any sauce vegan with the exception of like 2 (the menu is so large with 100+ dishes). Yes, this was probably the most difficult order I've had to place because of the specific ingredients needed to make these type of dishes... but in the end it all worked out. It took my waitress a few times back and forth with the kitchen to really confirm what was in some dishes and if they could be made without a specific ingredient (some things are already pre-made like the milk in the curry sauce they use but other things like the fish sauce on veggies are usually freshly added so can just be easily made without). Thumbs up to the chefs. I may have had to repeat, ""no milk, no eggs, no fish sauce, no honey"".. quite a number of times... but everyone was super nice and accommodating.Customer service is A+, food is A+, oh and I almost forgot to mention the portions are Large and very reasonably priced !!!! The place is also very clean and the decor and marketing inside is very hip and On point to cater to both, the young modern hipster and the authentic chinese connoisseur, at the same time."

From the outside, the restaurant doesn't look very...appealing. It appears to be small & run down. I went based on a recommendation from a friend and boy am I glad I listened! The interior of the restaurant is really nice and despite looking rather small from the outside, it's actually quite large and spacious! You don't feel crammed up (even during their busier times). The menu is HUGE (almost too big), which makes it so hard to decide! Each food item is properly described for those of us that are not familiar with Asian foods/terms. Their noodles are cooked to perfection & sauteed to the most flavorful ability. Bonus: tea is free with, unlimited...and yummy!However...just be careful if you're the specific type (ie: if you ask for no egg, make sure there's no egg...requests aren't always paid attention to). Service is mostly friendly, but try not to take too long to decide what you want."
