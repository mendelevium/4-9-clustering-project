/user_details?userid=CfKT4Pr7QYIUlcq4fnKfgg,Clara S.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"Really not a fan of the wait that comes with this popular restaurant, but I guess that's what is to be expected with such a crowded spot. It's right by the water and all outdoors, so it's popular this time of year for good reason. It also has a nice dj pumping some club music to get the vibes going too. People dress like they are going to the club here..one thing my coworker's and I did not come prepared for..We had some glasses of red wine and ordered after waiting for our waitress forever. The charcuterie board was delicious and of good portion, and the kale and goat cheese salad was also another great healthy starter. The beets in this salad were tasty and sweet. I also got the grilled salmon, which was kind of small and really salty. We also ordered another round of our reds, which I noticed I received a much different tasting glass the second time around..so now I have no idea which red I ended up drinking...Our waitress was nice, just expect the service to be slow at first and waiting in line for a table beforehand. Come dressed to impressed and ready to party. It's a good spot for drinks and very small plates before going out."

Food was really good (especially the mini macs) and the sangria was super delicious (although maybe watered down). Nice atmosphere and sweet staff. However, I would not recommend if you are a big group and looking for a nice sit down meal. We were too many to sit at a table so they put us down on the couches. We ended up eating our food on our laps, which isn't the most amazing meal experience. The fruit smoothies they brought as a substitute for mimosas were terrible (none of us could finish them). Overall, would come again if it was just me and another friend. Cannot comment on how it is for boozy brunch later in the evening though, but I would be open to trying that out."

We were walking around old Montreal and on a rather cooler day, decided to take a walk around the harbor.This place is bit of a walk, but the set-up itself is pretty good and it was the 7 of us and we were seated in a Cabana - comfortable seating too.We ordered some finger food and a few drinks - nothing great about both and we found this place to be a little expensive. Service however was excellent and they have a very friendly and welcoming staff."

This week I brought my elderly father for a walk to the Old Port, we passed by and he needed to use the bathroom, I explained the bouncer it was an emergency situation and still he was reluctant to allow him use the bathroom for a couple of minutes. I fully understand that some establishments have restrooms only for customers but sometimes one has to be flexible given the circumstances, instead, the bouncer refused the access with a smirk on his face and was starting to become aggressive. As far as I am concerned this place does not deserve my money and can go out of business anytime, probably it will and when it happens I won't be ashamed to say that I will feel a bit of ""schadenfreude"""

It was an experience, how to say this hum ... interesting, because it has confirmed several things to me including stuff about myself:A) A pitch of sangria at the price of $ 30, does not necessarily mean that the content will be of quality (*cough cough* kool-aid)B) A lounge bar with such an idyllic location does not mean that the clientele will be as consistentC) As I get older, soirées populated of under 21s are not really my thingNeedless to say that I will not go back but at least I tried."

The location and the decor are impeccable. The points drop with the loud music and very young crowd.

I suggested we go here since we were in old port and didn't want to travel far. We should have travelled further...We first had 2 glasses of sparkling wine which took forever to be served. And not just a long time for drinks, but a long time for anything to be served at a restaurant. We also had 2 salmon tartares and a salad to share. The tartare was ok but Montreal has so many great tartares, why settle for that? They served it with 3 pieces of bread soaked in butter so it was soggy - it was terrible. The salad was also just ok with the vinaigrette being too sweet. Overall, it was really mediocre food with a price well above that.They do have a nice terasse but it's not worth the overpriced food you get with it."

I have to say that despite its stellar location the Terrasse Bonsecours is not worth the visit.  Save your money and go elsewhere."

We had just purchased TWO more bottles and they made us leave full bottles. I will never visit this establishment again because of this treatment."
/user_details?userid=hOXDcekNFwfXz5BVOxqkkQ,Ed H.,"Clovis, CA",1 star rating,Horrible management and client services.  I'm a medical doctor from California.  I called the venue and was told a reservation was not necessary. I insisted on a reservation to no avail.  She emphasized once again that it was not necessary due to the time of the day.  On arrival(approximately 4:20pm) security and later the manager(Desmond) asked if I had a reservation.  I explained the phone conversation to them and though they understood the miscommunication they refused to allow me entry.  The venue was not full at the time and while I waited other clients arrived who were not on the stated guest list but were allowed in without issue.  I do not want to rush to conclusions but I can only wonder if my appearance played a role as the other clients who were let in were white.It's unfortunate for the owner because the manager and security team are distorting the image of the business.  I hope the owner of the venue is aware and I encourage everyone to take time to write a review good or bad.If my experience is an isolated event the good reviews will drown the bad.  I was at the venue about a month ago without incident so it may just be an isolated event.

Security everywhere and doormen and it's only 6pm. Lower level has a bar and tables ( reservations suggested ) upper level is more relaxed, long bar, highTop tables with views of the port. ( Kodak moment) and views of lower level. Music is electronic/ house/ loungey. Not terribly loud. Friendly service. The biggest surprise was the POUR. It's not freehand or bartenders discretion. It's computerized. So if your drink isn't "" strong "" enough, be ready to pay for more/ shot. This is the ONLY place I have seen using this technology.

Unfortunately there are no other pros.Even for a Tuesday evening service was slow and casual. Drinks were served quickly but the ""tapas style"" food was not worth the trip. All 3 of our orders came out at varied times (make that 2 out of 3 as it wasn't until everyone got their food that they mentioned they were out of whatever I had ordered).We barely saw our server throughout our stay but she made a lasting impression when she mentioned to a friend that a 15% tip wasn't included - note that this was after she had already been tipped over 15% by said friend. The food itself came in the teeniest tapa portion I've seen and cost the price of what could be a full meal.Overall generally unimpressed. :("

And then, to pay, it was the same thing. We had to ask someone if we could have the bill after waiting a long time. But, this time she was faster ;-) The food was horrible.

After having two friends work their as models that serve, I can ensure you the staff here are treated little better than dogs. Nothing but a sleezy place made by some money hungry bros.

But the service and drinks were so horrendous that it's hard to put words to it. We sat and the hostess gave us 1 menu for 3 people. Lol. We asked to be in the shade, so she put us next to a bush that was completely infested in bees. Also, rather than putting us in the shade, she put an umbrella up above the table beside us - nice gesture but it covered half of the table.. sucks for the third person in our party. We then had to ask three times for water.. and by 3 times I mean it took 45 minutes. We also had some drink issues. I asked for a margarita on the rocks and when she brought it, she said ""I just put ice in the frozen one"" ....k. Our Jim beam lemonade (the actual name of the drink) was just pure sour mix. They even forgot the alcohol. It was LIME GREEN. Both drinks got sent back in favor of wine - one of us ordered a glass before the other discovered we could get a bottle for less. Could not cancel the glass. ""I can't send it back again"" was actually said. The food was good but portioned out for 3-7 year olds. The chicken tacos (meal) were 3 tortillas the size of the bottom of a pint glass. The steak was $30 and the size of my palm. The octopus was very good until I involuntarily threw it up a few hours later. Not a drill. It was also really exciting when it rained. Does it rain much in Montreal? Because the staff does not know how to handle it. They ran around clearing the empty tables of utensils and left us and our food in the rain lol. lol. We moved our own items including chairs, table, and the marbled bottom umbrella while they quite literally watched. Again, lol.I asked for the check when the food arrived mostly because we were there for 2 hours before the food came and we assume itd take just as long for everything else. Assumption was accurate. I'd skip this place. Cool vibe but should probably consider hiring trained wait staff that isn't bottle girls running around in poorly fitted bra dresses, mingling with men at tables rather than actually waiting tables. I mean, just a thought?"

I ordered a half-pitcher of a drink but it took so long for me to get it that they were nice enough to give me a whole pitcher for the price of the half.

From the outside this place oversees a great view of the city, but the service is awful and not worth the view. We arrived early in the night around 10pm where there were only a handful of people in the club. Ordered a bottle from the bottle service menu and received terrible service. We were disappointed to find out that there was no seating or lounge section for bottle service if less than 3 bottles were purchased. Our waitress was rude and didn't bother to check on us to refill our mixers (juices and tonic). Our tip reflected the service as we only gave 10% on a $200+ bill. The waitress returned with our money and told us that this was far less than what is customary and said 15% is average. After a brief conversation with her manager, it was determined that 10% was extremely generous. The bathroom at this facility is probably the most disgusting thing I have ever witnessed. It is no where connected to the club and you must walk outside and into a basement of another building next door. The basement is poorly lit and clearly has not been disinfected in quite some time. The aroma you get as soon as you walk halfway down the stairs is extremely putrid. The DJ played good dance music and once the night progressed the club filled up with patrons. I think rating this place 1 star was even too generous."

The ice was not slushed properly, still chunky and not mixed well with the other liquids used. The blue raspberry was pretty much vodka in ice with barely any other flavors. The cucumber and basil was extremely bland and practically no basil taste. Not recommended."

On a hot day you're going to be baking under the sun unless you get seating under the shade. The outdoor grill smokes the place up, they need an exhaust system to send that smoke elsewhere. Food doesn't seem bad but I wouldn't want to put down that burger between two Belgian waffles and eggs on a sweltering day, go to Dolcetto on Saint Paul first. I would definitely get there by 5 or 6 and get it popping--cool house music, very trendy crowd, sweet bartenders, gets really packed so stay away if crowds aren't your thing."
/user_details?userid=vESbH0wH-N4hXMPwxYg6rQ,Michael G.,"Westport, CT",2 star rating,Probably a great place for a night time drink. Not so much for a meal. The decor is okay but there were a lot of bugs and broken glass in the cabanas. Odd they chose not to address that when we pointed it out. Food is ok at best. The view from the dining area is poor as it is sunken. So there is no river view. You are better off going across the street to a proper restaurant.
/user_details?userid=ewrfMC8uik_MioaA4NSEug,Richard T.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Worst place ever. Service was slow, waitress was extremely rude. That was the dinner part. As for the club, staff pushes you around and one of them cussed at us. The owner did not care and didn't do anything. To the owner: learn to run your business, you are doing a horrible job and are in need of a refresh on customer service. Take it from me go somewhere else this place is an absolute nightmare!"
/user_details?userid=dLB7Kir5aN288IbQO9rA_A,Christopher S.,"Whippany, NJ",1 star rating,We ordered a bottle and literally had the worst waitress ever we gave her a tip to reflect her attitude and service (10%) she then came back and said I usually get 15% and then began to make us explain ourselves why we gave her a bad tip.... She then said well fine I need to call the manger we explained the situation and he was understating and we got  a new waitress....
/user_details?userid=hMY0wsj3VxOaBixV_6YnuA,Gregory S.,"Houston, TX",3 star rating,"The location is perfect on the water in Old Montreal.  On warm summer evenings you get the cooling breeze off the Saint Lawrence.  Everything is open and airy.There are two areas, the patio with all the tables for food and drinks and then the club itself on a few floors.  The portion sizes are pretty small for the price of the meal and it isn't that great.  I suggest getting a lot of platters to share.  They have a lot of choices for the drinks such as various creations of martinis.  They also serve champagne cocktails as well.The club plays a variety of music from hip hop to house to trance to reggaeton it suits a diverse mixture of people.  The crowd is a eclectic mix of all that Montreal has to offer.  As stated before, its perfect on a warm summer night to enjoy the breezes.  The top floor is for bottle service and has nice couches to chill and relax.  It's a different night out than the usual."
/user_details?userid=JudEGM3yUpeTB3ex5YEojQ,Leah M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Portions are  small and ridiculously over priced. Super loud and bad music playing as you eat which really ruins the whole ambiance. Food was alright and sangria was good. Would not recommend.
/user_details?userid=8_A_OdF_OS_PHHyDE2GiZw,Jay D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Well... I have to say that it's not always good but when you hit a good night it's just amazing. It's better to go when it's a sunny Saturday/Sunday. It's a good place to be all dress up, good Djs there. I like the staff, very friendly.I have to admit I never tried the food because it's more a place for party and I assume that going in a restaurant is wiser...But overall I had the craziest night there. And I'm talking about party, not food."
/user_details?userid=p1CYr8Nsl6URPiqJKjEc2Q,Simon P.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I have had some bad experiences in the past, but never so bad i felt compelled to write a yelp review. The process of downloading the yelp app and creating an account was painfully slow, but it was definitevely worth it if this review makes this sleazy business lose even a single client. Where to start, the sassy waitress who felt it was necessary to be rude despite not having a table ready 50 min after my resevation. We were told to sit at the bar and that they would call us once the table was ready. What she didn't mention is that there was no room at the bar and she expected us to stand around in a corner. It was clear that nobody had any idea how to organise a reservation system. The hostess, on top of the constant rudeness, was more confused than a hungry baby at a topless bar.  This place is to bars what donald trump is to politics, pretentious, dumb, and dishonest. Avoid the bar and avoid people who like it."

Great music, good crowd (mid-twenties I'd say), friendly staff and cute waitresses.  View is pretty sweet.  Definitely the go to place for a summer night."
