/user_details?userid=pjkXK-rujVoGDDo5wagqdQ,Zainab N.,"Longueuil, Canada",4 star rating,"Food was good. We ordered two dishes chicken and cashews and thai green curry. Thai green curry however had very few chicken bites. And they also gave rice for only one person. They also only provided rice for one person, which we found out when we got back home."
/user_details?userid=JoVrzT6QTcTeRmXQdQg02w,Yvette G.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Madame Thai is a warm and inviting modern Thai restaurant. I came here with my best friend and we each got the table d'hôte, which included a drink, a soup, an appetizer, and a main dish. We had the jasmine tea, it was ok. Then for soups, we got a Tom Kha and Tom Yam, both vegetarian. They were pretty good. For appetizers, we got a mango salad as well as beef dumplings. Those were my favourite from the whole meal. For our main dishes, we ordered a Chicken Madame Thai and a Beef Pad Sew. They were good, but the Pad Sew had way too much pepper. Also, service was very slow. It took about 45 minutes to get our main dish after we had finished the appetizers."

The waiters are attentive and the service itself was very quick.My friend and I went on a Sunday evening during the summer, expecting it to be full but it wasn't. We chose the menu for two, which came down to approximately 50$ for both of us, which is very affordable.The food itself was good, not anything out of the ordinary. The best two plates that we've had were the mango salad and the général Thai chicken.However, I was quite disappointed by the food for one important reason: I had told the waitress I did not want cilantro at all costs because I cannot tolerate it. She said it was not a problem and that they could make the food without it easily. Perhaps, she might've forgotten because the food came full of cilantro and even removing it, it's a herb so the taste was still impregnated in the food. If I were to go again, I would only order one plate, because the soup we've had as an entrée wasn't really amazing."

Ma copine a aimé sont poulet général Thai mais aurait aimé plus de légumes.Bon choix de restaurant asiatique à Longueuil."
/user_details?userid=iVXISIgh-unsJz57-qOHTQ,Sheryl L.,"Candiac, Canada",3 star rating,"Cute little place in old Longueuil, easy to spot and an quite an easy area to find parking. Ive heard some great things about this place, so i had some high expectations . Service was good,quick and attentive.Food was alright...For entrees we ordered Beignets maison de crabe frits and the Rouleau de printemps au crevettes. The two beignets were a little over fried on the outside. The inside was filled with shredded crab,a good combination with the spicy mayo.The Rouleau de printemps au crevettes, were disappointing. It's an over powering taste of mint, which takes away from any taste of shrimp. It comes with a sweet and sour Thai sauce with some crushed peanuts on top. (Reminds me of the Thai sauce from Costco)For the main course, we ordered Madame Thai beef and the beef pad thai.The madame thai beef had a good taste but very salty. It comes with jasmine rice, which help tone down the saltiness but if you want to take a bite of the veggies or beef alone its way too salty. The beef pad thai was good but not amazing. The portion was quite small for the price of $15.95. Flavourful, good amount of eggs and crushed nuts with 1 piece of tofu.Overall, a cute place in old Longueuil with average Thai food."

I ordered a cashew chicken and a pad thai. The cashew chicken was very good; there was lots of cashews in it. The only reason I gave the restaurant 4 stars was because the prices were a bit high. I have been to Thailand, and this Thai food is just as good as the Mother Country's!"
/user_details?userid=JrTsaMac8BnAkLuJ3MfGzA,Aileen L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"ATMOSPHERE: I loved the aesthetic of this restaurant. It's a nice mix between a cafe-style and cozy restaurant ambiance. The place is not too small either which is nice.FOOD: Flavour wise, this place was great. However, it was WAY too salty. They could have used half the salt amount that they put and it would have been fine. Both the soup and the main course was overly salty. I got the Madame Thai beef dish and it was delicious but portion could have been slightly bigger.PRICE: Not too bad but definitely overpriced. Noodle dishes ranged from 14-16$ (you can get the same thing elsewhere for 10$ usually). I think the dishes should have been bigger for the price we paid but since its a ""bistro"" type, I guess this is normal.SERVICE: The staff was very friendly. They were quick and efficient. No problems here."

We were very pleasantly surprised and would rate this up there with some of the best Thai food we have had. We learned that the chefs are all Thai and use authentic recipes from back home. Definitely recommended."
/user_details?userid=uKJwRZUyOIViWCbhA5WU_A,Jaya R.,"Queens, Queens, NY",4 star rating,My husband and I were there while on one of his business trips. Granted that we are from New York (which has so many amazing Thai restaurants) Madame Thai was definitely a great choice. The decor is very simple and clean cut. The customer service is amazing. Being that the main language spoken in Quebec is French we only spoke English. Our waiter was fluent in English which was a major plus.  The food is absolutely amazing. Very flavorful and cooked to perfection. If I was ever in Quebec again I would definitely stop in.

Was looking forward to trying it because there are not a lot of Thai restaurants in the South Shore that offer crispy rice salad.I ordered every salad they had on the menu and a few other dishes. Even ordered 2 different types of soup. Every single dish was bland like they ran out of fish sauce when they were making it or something. Fish sauce is one of the main ingredients in Thai/Lao food!! The Tom Yam (btw it's supposed to be Tom Yum) soup was sour and tasted artificial. It was worse than eating Thai Express. Avoid this place if you're looking for authentic Thai food. Actually, avoid this place if you're looking for food with any flavor."
