They had a smaller menu but everything on the menu looked incredible. It was really hard to choose only a few dishes, so I'll have to go back soon! We ended up ordering plantains and guacamole, the Haitian patties (in both cod and beef), the griot plate with makawoni and riz collé, and as part of a YES Perk, we got a Pikliz Poutine. The restaurant itself was really cute and had great decor and music. There's not a lot of places to sit. There's parking street parking around but not directly in front of the restaurant. If you have mobility issues, the doors also didn't look like they were accessible (and had an additional step up). Since this is a COVID time review, I was there for takeout. Service was fantastic. They let me take my time in deciding and if I had any questions, they welcomed the questions. They also took the time to explain the sauces that same with the food. Considering I ordered quite a bit, I didn't wait too long either! The food itself: when we finally got home to try it, our car was smelling INCREDIBLE! I was so excited since I LOVE Haitian food. Everything was still hot when we got home, and we dug in straight away. Everything was delicious and there were so many different textures and tastes for the food. It's hard to choose a favourite when you love everything! I really liked their pikliz: spicy and acidic, so yummy and goes perfectly with the rest of the food (especially the poutine!) I can't wait to go back to try the rest of the dishes!"

It is conveniently located next to metro station and in a neighborhood that is not very busy, where parking is just easier. I really enjoyed the pikliz poutine, the griot was full of flavors. The portion was big and I ended up with leftovers for lunch, which were delicious even the next day. We also ordered the crispy shrimp, heavenly! The main dishes come with some hot sauces and the pickled cabbage pikliz, as well as two sides, I chose the plantains and mini guacamole. These extras added additional spiciness and richness to the shrimp. Last but not least, don't miss to try the dessert of the day, the upside down cake with pineapple was perfect with coffee the next morning.I'll be very happy to visit again Pikliz for more shrimp goodness one day, when we can sit on a table in this cozy little space and dream of Southern seas while savoring yummy Caribbean food."
/user_details?userid=5QrlMMzUq_RoUlEyH2zcig,Judy K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,We were in the Yelp Elite Perk: Piklìz Poutine!And this is hands down the best poutine in the city. The owner gave us a side of his home made pikliz sauce and it's just delicious. Service was really friendly and food came out quickly. The resto is tiny and only seats about 10 people give or take and has a great music playing. Will definitely go back to try the rest of the menu.

I tried the pikliz poutine, the bannann pezé and the beef and fish pâtés. They were all very good and flavorful. The griot on the poutine was very tender. The plantains were crunchy on the outside and the sauce that came with it was delicious. The staff was nice and friendly and the service was quick. Would definitely come back."

Their wangs are yammy and griyo is very filling. The service is great too! The place is literally next to the metro station so if you are traveling from another neighbourhood, your food will stay warm. Definitely recommend!"
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Discovered Pikliz through a Yelp elite event. You can order online or over the phone, the menu is really clear and most dishes come with a choice of 1 or 2 sides. We ordered the griot wrap, the poutine, the creole green beans and a side of plantains. Everything was delicious but the griot wrap and poutine really stood out. I really didn't expect the poutine to be THAT GOOD, it was delicious. It had the perfect amount of cheese curds, sauce and fries and the griot just went so well in the poutine. The wrap was just delicious as well!"

Loved their green beans salad & cant wait for it to get back on the menu. Their plantains are always crispy & delicious. Soft spot for their codfish chicktay.

/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"To the best of my knowledge, the name 'pikliz' might be a direct translation from 'pickle' SOMETHING. It is, in fact, Haitian style pickled cabbage. And the pikliz here packs the right amount of heat and complements every other dining elements very well. I recommend adding a side of pikliz if it doesn't come with your order. I dropped by Pikliz within their first week of opening and tried their griot (fried pork) and kalalou (okra). I thought the okra was delicious (4.5/5), but the griyo was rather bland and dry (3/5). In terms of flavours, the chefs paired the griyo plate with different sauces (see photo) and the flavours DID pair, but it wasn't enough, in my opinion, to save it from the tough filament like texture of dried pork. I also ordered a beef patty (4/5). It was flaky and homey, but could use more filling. Overall, the one thing that makes me remember Pikliz was -- the pikliz. It did a good job adding dimension to the fried pork and I feel like it could bring any food to life."

One evening, I had a long day and I decided to try it out to encourage a local business. It did not disappoint I had the chicken with rice and salad and it was amazing. I highly recommend trying it!"
