If I stumbled upon it on my own I might feel the same way, but it doesn't live up to the hype. It's perfectly lovely, but there are a lot of perfectly lovely spots in Montreal.On weekends it can get a little hectic, but during the week it's more relaxed and a nice spot to work. The food is good, but I haven't found it super memorable. I appreciate that the menu is curated, so there are enough options without having too many options. Everything is plated very well -- the whole place is ready for Instagram."

We got there around 11:00. A waitress came over and said it would be a 5-15 min wait for the three of us. 15 minutes went by and we were still waiting. Then, we saw a family of four who came in 10 minutes after us sit down. We were annoyed, and even more so when were seated 25 minutes later. I wanted to order a scone, but they had run out. I ordered the classic breakfast instead, which was fine. My friend wanted ham on her breakfast sandwich but they had run out of ham as well.Overall would not recommend this place. It was cute inside, but I wasn't a fan of the service."

The interior restaurant is so charming and decorated with beautiful artwork. Today was their first terrace day and we we're lucky enough to get a table in the sun! We were greeted by our waitress Sophie. She was kind, friendly and attentive and had no problem accommodating my friend with a gluten free meal! Their brunch menu is quite consice with only 8 or so options but each selection is unique and uses seasonal ingredients. I ordered the cod cakes served with a salad and packed egg. The crab cakes were delicious! They were perfectly cooked and were filled with a substantial amount of cod. The frying was perfect, the cakes were crunchy and not soggy. I also ordered he cheese and onion scone because review said they were really good. I thought it was very good but I think Le parloir et Burgundy Lion make a better scone. My friends ordered the bread pudding, which was delicious, and the classic breakfast. Will definitely be back!"

I love that this place has plenty of outlets where people could actually get some work done there while having meals, snacks or coffee and getting their phones or laptops charged. I've gone to this place twice. One for just coffee and bakery and the 2nd time was for brunch. The food wasn't so bad, actually. Although, I wasn't so fond of the latte there that much. I was a bit frustrated about their brunch menu since they didn't have a few things on the menu even though we got there quite early. So I had to settle for something else, and it ended up saving the day. It was a huge plate and I loved the presentation. This place was quite dim inside so you might not get good lighting for your IG photos."

I really loved their potato slices on the side though, and the salad was tasty. Service is good, and the restaurant is clean and pretty. It's not the type of noisy brunch place that you go to with tons of your friends after a night out. It's more of a catch up over coffee, stay for 3 hours and end up eating there kinda place."

/user_details?userid=SQIfkwKkwH_iD-urr0Fiew,Jenna I.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Had brunch here before I got on a bus to a plane to another plane to another bus to home. REALLY cute place - it feels artsy and fun. There's books lining the windows and they're all actually thoughtfully chosen titles, from art books to classic bohemian, music, and philosophical reads. Good job getting that authentic feel.The food itself is also excellent, I had a solid breakfast of eggs, think sliced potatoes, merguez, and buttered toast. Everything you want out of a breakfast, and all cooked perfectly. Their filter coffee is excellent too, I even bought a pound of ground coffee to go from them.Nice spot. Would definitely come here often if I lived anywhere in this country. Two thumbs up!"

We had just arrived in Montreal for the weekend and I stumbled across this place on Eater Montreal as a great spot for brunch. We came here on a Thursday around 11:30 AM and the 3 of us sat right down. The decor and athmosphere is super cute and trendy - industrial bulbs with greenery and lots of books.Their food was delicious - I ordered their Fairmount Bagel which was a delicious bagel with Lox - it tasted so fresh and light. My siblings got the Cod Cake which at first looked like it would be super heavy, but again, surprisingly delicious and light. For drinks, we also got their Bloody Cesar which may have been the best bloody mary I have ever had - their secret is the Montreal steak seasoned rim! I definitely recommend!"

The duck was crispy yet juicy. The melted cheese was delectable. My biggest problem was that the egg was way over-cooked. The runniness of the poached egg would have added a great dimension of flavor to the dish."
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Summer in Montreal is so short so we have to capitalize on every moment.  In this instance I decided to make the most of a beautiful summer day by coming to eat brunch with a friend on Arts Café's beautiful terrasse.  This adorable café is located in Mile End and has a beautiful little street terrasse where you can sit out side and soak up some sun.They have a small menu but the items all look very tempting.  Ultimately I ordered eggs benedict with duck confit.  They did an interesting take on this classic brunch food though.  Instead of an English muffin as the base they used a waffle, which was stuffed with the duck confit.  I really enjoyed it.  The portion size was just right and I felt very content when I was done eating.  The price was very reasonable.  That being said the orange juice I ordered was overpriced at $6 a glass.  It was freshly squeezed but the price was a little steep for my liking.Despite it being a Saturday afternoon there was no line up so we were seated right away.  Service was also quick and pretty good as a whole. The whole experience here was very enjoyable and I would definitely want to come back here in the future."

The cafe is adorable inside and out - that patio is not on a busy main street and people watching is perfect while sipping latte or freshly squeezed. Servers are attentive and warm, I'll come back again and again. The whole place has an artsy chilled vibe, a perfect little spot to watch the world go by. Cod cake - is delicate and crispy on the outside, the accompanied dill sauce is artfully plated.Poutine - scallop potato on gooey cheese and tender smoked duck. Eggs Benny on brioche - good overall but the blue cheese on sweet potato was the star of the plate. Montreal + brunch, qui, qui!"
/user_details?userid=qEVzzrg5tjnmZlYmSFTCSg,Phil C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I walked by this place a lot on my business trips to Montreal. I was convinced to go in by one of my staff because the aesthetic is great. I'm a coffee snob so I thought I'd try them out eventually anyway. The thing is, the coffee was adequate, but the food, was, a, complete, surprise. I loved the soup and the snacks. I can't wait to try it again. The food was ridiculously tasty and the best part was that it was not what I went in for. I could tell from looking at the people around me that they all had a similar discovery at some point in their lives and were keeping their own little secrets. They looked at me like I was in a react video. They wanted to see how I'd take it.It felt like a little secret club of happy people with happy secrets. I highly recommend going here and grabbing a bite! ... and maybe a coffee."

So decided to come again but a weekday, Monday at 09am... no line up at all! :) quiet ambiance for a nice breakfast and meeting with a friend. Loveee the decor!!!! Lots of lightbulb lighting hanging at the windows, it's pretty neat! For the menu, I opted for something different than the traditional egg potato bacon plate. I ordered the ""Shakshuka"": cumin cardamom sauce, quinoa, baked egg, potato toast with choice of merguezIt was really good!!! A good salty plate and finished off with a blueberry scone. Delicious!Easy to find free parking."

A downside is that you have to pay for each cup of filtered coffee (free refills on filtered coffee should be a given, especially in a breakfast place). I'll definitely be returning to try more options on their menu soon."
/user_details?userid=dcxD80M4CefoVkHFjNDscg,Reese D.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I gave two stars only because they didn't charge me for my meal. I ordered the duck confit Benedictine. There was a teaspoon of duck confit, flavourless (lack of salt) hollandaise and eggs that were barely runny. I was served my plate while my two co-diners watched me. They were waiting long enough that I was able to finish my underwhelming dish. The concept was good but the execution was off. Also, charging 15$ for that little duck confit (literally one bite) is seriously. My co-diners just decided to leave once we were told that there was an error and that their dishes would be out within 5 minutes."

We stopped here for brunch after hearing there was a 45 minute wait for Lawrence down the street - and we're so glad we ended up here. The decor is what made us stop in - it's filled with plant life and shelves lined with old books, making it feel so homey. I had the shakshuka with polenta, which was crispy and delicious. The shakshuka itself was great too. It was a small portion size, but it was just the right amount to leave you feeling satisfied. It was pretty packed for brunch but if it's quieter during off hours, I imagine it would be a nice place to stop for a hot drink and a good book."
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Years ago this used to be the place where a lot of my unemployed artist friends would land semi-permanent serving and cooking jobs- the space and food reflected this mentality and was a good time but definitely nothing fancy.As much as the space will forever be remembered as such in my mind, I love what Arts Café has become. The coffee, service, space and above all, food are great. The first time I was back recently I ordered the shakshuka with the polenta and was really impressed with the delicate composition of the dish (they use quinoa!) along with the perfect portions. The next time I ordered the simple breakfast, and while I could have gone for a bigger plate, I really enjoyed my meal.The big win for this place for me is that they serve a great brunch all week long. If your weekend is an unconventional one like mine, this place is a dream."

/user_details?userid=fi38ETFUNBBndrkKqLqUtA,Tina M.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"It took us a while, my husband and I, to discover Arts Café, but once we tried it, we decided it was one of the best coffee shops in the city and proceeded to return as frequently as possible, in spite of the distance that separates us, Sud-Ouest dwellers, from the feisty Mile-End neighborhood. Tastefully decorated and with walls filled with a fair collection of interesting and colorful art and design books, as well as manifestos, Arts Café is zen and inviting, harboring a serene atmosphere whether one visits it in the early morning or the late evening. 49th Parralel supplies their espresso and all the espresso, macchiato and latte they've served us so far have been perfect.We've also had the pleasure of trying their cheddar and raspberry scones, served with a side of fresh cream. Until I had Arts Café's scones, I felt very neutral about scones in general. I now know what a scone is supposed to taste like; buttery, fluffy, soft and tasty goodness. All the other scones sold in the city now seem sub-par in comparison!Arts Café is a haven, and in my humble opinion, one of Mile-End's best coffee establishments."

The coffee is absolute perfection. So good it even managed to convince my non-coffee drinking husband (I know, right!) to order a latte. So velvety and smooth, this coffee might just change your life. They also have lovely brunch options. From magret de canard and waffles, to a breakfast sandwich or granola, everything on their menu is fresh and purposeful. I also love their baked goods, especially the scones and jam. Haven't tried their lunch or dinner menu, but judging by everything else I'm sure it's delightful. One of the main highlights at Arts is definitely the ambiance. The space is bright and comfortable, without being pretentious. I personally love to come here on a weekday, when it's not too busy to work for an hour or so, and get re-energized. In the summer, they also have a quaint terrace, which is perfect for procrastinating. Service seems to be hit or miss, but overall I am a fan of this place."

/user_details?userid=5hiApxc8kZNf4sCyUw-NLA,Grace W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We love it! I brought my mom here on a weekday for her last day of visit here. We both love this place's simplicity and lovely decor, along with the cleanliness and efficiency expected of a good restaurant. The wait time can vary depending on the waiter serving you, we started off with a slower (perhaps a newer) waiter who took a while to give us the menu and water. But things started to pick up, when another one came to take our orders and continued to serve us for the rest of the meal. The food! The food is amazing! It seems to be a fusion of Middle Eastern cuisine coupled with some Western styled breakfast ideas. My mom had the Vegetarian Sandwich, which was made with walnut falafel and fresh salad on the side. She absolutely loved it (which is a relief because she has the taste palate comparable to a food critic). I had the Shakshuka; it was so delicious and its cumin seasonings were so memorable, I would definitely go back and try some more. The menu was not expensive and fairly priced for its great food quality, but a consideration is that some of the dishes may have smaller portion than standard brunch meals. My mother's portion was a little bit more than mine, but I don't eat much so I finished mine and was comfortably full. Usually after finishing big brunch meals, I easily get food coma yet after eating at Arts Cafe, the food made me feel refreshed and energized. This is for sure a place I would hope to return for more."

The iconic part is the rainbow colour blocks, just love it! Didn't get the chance to try the brunch yet but judging from the mouthwatering smell from tables around us, I need to come back and try their food!"

Arts cafe had a shakshouka on the menu, and it had good reviews so we went. Food: I did have the shakshouka - it had a unique clove flavored tomato base, the egg was still oozy when I cut into it (good sign!) and the merguez sausage was good. I liked it. My partner had a more standard dish - eggs and potatoes, with a couple of small polenta bricks, which was fine. I also ordered a cortado and was impressed that it was a high quality drink (often non coffee shops don't quite hit the nail on the head with their espresso drinks). Overall the food gets a 4Ambience: we went in the day, and the windows were open bringing in the sunlight. It was just the right size and has a bunch of lightbulbs hanging down one wall - I imagine these look really nice lit at night. Ambience gets a 3.5- 4. Service: Service was good - our server friendly-ish and efficient despite being very busy. Service gets a 4.Overall, I'd recommend this place for the food, the coffee and the overall vibe!"

We came for brunch and tried the shakshuka and the farmount bagel sandwich. Both were excellent - the bagel comes with a very nice lemon cream cheese and fresh capers. I'd prefer smoked salmon as the trout was a bit too subtle. The shakshuka was perfectly spiced and came with a yummy polenta loaf. Though the food was tasty, the wait was not so hot. Minus points for long wait times and slow coffee service."

After ordering it took about 45 minutes to get 2 Classic breakfasts and 1 shakshuka. Overall the food was good however the service spoiled the whole event. To add insult to injury we were charged for refills of coffee (standard filter coffee). Do not recommend on a weekend for brunch.

Had the cider (nice and light!) and the trout and and dill cream cheese bagel, the presentation was absolutely beautiful and it tasted just as great!

I think I need to give this place another shot. I had the Shakshuka and I was a little disappointed with it. The tomato sauce and eggs just didn't excite me too much. The merguez that was served with it was tasty though. My bf got the vegetarian sandwich which was very good! Great bread, great hummus and overall great flavor. Definitely recommend getting that! I should have gone with the benedict offering. I saw some other customers order it and it looked both delicious and filling. The service was very slow. We ordered pretty quickly and I had to wait about 20-25 minutes for the latte that I ordered and then another 15 minutes for the meal. We did come on a Sunday afternoon at 11 am, though, so it could just be the day.I also bought some of their coffee, and the person helping me was extremely helpful.Overall, I need to give this place another try.

If the management thinks that people will come to this place back no matter what, they should think twice. Montreal is a small place, and people know what's going on. I have experienced horrible attitude from the servers two times and heard/read many things on Instagram regarding the servers and service. They have to get their act together. There're many other brunch spots out there. + I'd rather pay for a decent food and a friendly service rather than eating at ""the"" popular spot."

We ordered the original breakfast which included eggs, potatoes, vegetables, bacon, and the most delicious toast I've ever tried. All of that food yet the serving was just right. The service was incredible. Our waitress was extremely polite and patient with us and our non-French speaking selves. She did not make us feel rushed; but rather made us feel quite welcomed. The area where this restaurant is located is quite home-y. The area wasn't crowded and there wasn't any traffic. I will recommend to all my friends that visit Montreal!"

/user_details?userid=T8-xFr2St3Go58Pomb_ChQ,Sheer P.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I had come here a few months ago and had quite liked the eggs benedict and the waffle. However, after going back again recently, my experience was very different. The waffles we ordered lacked the ""seasonal fruit"" as indicated on the menu, consisting simply of 5-6 blueberries. The breakfast sandwich lacked substance - the ""guacamole"" consisted of a mere tbsp of avocade spread sparsely over the bread, and the taste was quite bland. Also, we were only informed when ordering that the sandwich is no longer offered with a side, as indicated on the menu. However, we were given the option of meat or polenta. At the end, I did feel quite dissatisfied paying $8 for a sandwich that was 90% bread. I've given two stars this time because their lattes and coffees are still quite delicious."

Now after the first time I've found myself back there 5 or 6 times to eat in under a month. The place has a really great atmosphere, not too loud but often quite crowded especially on weekends.Having tried a lot of their menu now I can personally recommend the Shakshuka for something savoury and if you have a sweet tooth you can't go past the waffles. They were just amazing!Their coffee is also great and the staff were very friendly. Their lattes are quite large and I'm not really a fan of that much milk so I've stuck with the cortados or espressos there and have not been disappointed yet.Be prepared for a small wait if it's a nice summer morning on a weekend. The place is quite popular"
/user_details?userid=xJAqt3U9L8UaeWwsqg263Q,Finlay L.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Arts Cafe was recommended by my friend's AirBnb host as a good spot for weekend brunch. It was one of my favorite places that we went, and I would 100% return if I find myself back in Montreal.The space is beautiful. I loved the wood floor, the light and airy room, and the hanging lights. Even the books scattered around looked interesting: I could imagine myself whiling away a chilly afternoon with a pot of tea and some art books.The menu looked great, and I'm sorry I couldn't try everything. I loved the breakfast plate I got here: perfectly scrambled eggs, beautiful potatoes and parsnips, buttery toast and baked beans with a side of merguez. It was the perfect start to a long weekend of shopping and sight-seeing. My friend also raved about her smoked trout bagel and coffee. I stuck to tea: also top-notch. I've had a falling out with Earl Grey lately, but their version re-converted me. The tea timer ensured I didn't over- or under-brew it.The only thing that would make Arts Cafe better is if they moved to Brooklyn!"

We split a scone (highly recommend the raspberry!) and we were blown away once our meals came. We each agreed that it was the best brunch we've had in a long time. The French toast is a must-try, and the poutine is delicious. I definitely plan to come back on my next trip to Montreal!"

It has a very cool row of light bulbs along the windows. The menu was simple and clean. We ordered Arts Burger and Shakshuka for brunch. The Arts Burger is a Burger of mixed pork and beef with some lettuce. It came with a side of greens made of lettuce and what I thought was bok-choy stems. The plate looked anemic. There was no color, just a pale green salad with a pale looking burger bun and patty. The salad was bland, it had a drop of sourness and that was it. Also, why were there oxidized stems? The Burger did taste pretty good.The Shakshuka wasn't bad; It had one egg and one sausage! Why only one? I like my sausages and eggs. For brunch, I feel there are better options around the area."

Third wave coffee service, incredible big mugs of filter coffee or a perfect latte go great with lovely brunch options like the daily Benedict special (roast cauliflower with garlic hollandaise?! Amazing.)"
/user_details?userid=i7dva-DqwjyAtLVc2idhNA,Pradeep K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Before this place got taken over by new ownership, the olds art cafe was one of the many great weekend breakfast options.Back then their breakfast menu were named after famous painters, my usual order was ""Le Wood"". They used to have open mike nights of Tuesday evenings and their chalk board had upcoming events.The new incarnation has not messed with the decor. The menu is very different from before and methinks (not confirmed) they keep changing their brunch menu each week(end). The chalkboard was not there so I am guessing it does not double as a venue anymore.Because of my bias to the older Arts Cafe, don't use my review as a touchstone. Maybe you will enjoy their fancy brunch offerings.I did enjoy flirting with the Australian host, unfortunately she is probably back in Melbourne! Oh well, maybe next I'll flirt with somebody from exotic Cairns or Darwin!"

I really liked the food and ambiance. The coffee was delicious as well - big plus for any brunch spot. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because of the service. The waiter serving us was one of rudest I've seen in a while. He couldn't be bothered to explain the menu or remember what we'd had, or even look at us. We all have bad days, but there was no effort on his part. That being said, it is a nice little spot and I would recommend it to anyone."

The food is delicious, the atmosphere is charming, and the service is good. They serve each tea with timers, which is a plus if you're fastidious about how long you steep your tea. The espresso drinks are pretty good, too, though not the most amazing I've had in Montreal.The baked goods are pretty great. They look heavier than they are, in fact. I tried a piece of grapefruit cake with basil cream cheese frosting. I could not figure out what was in the icing at first, and when I asked the waitress what was in it, her orgasmic expression was everything: she smiled, tilted her head back a bit in pleasure and said, ""MMm yeah, it's basil cream cheese."" I have also tried the parsnip soup, which was very good, and the breakfast sandwich which came with a nice side salad. All were very delicious, though not quite as memorable as the unique grapefruit + basil cake, that I will definitely be trying to recreate on my own some time!If you go on the weekends, be prepared to wait! Though service in Montreal is definitely not super speedy, be prepared to wait for your food a bit, too, as the kitchen is very tiny."

We came again for brunch and waited over 45mins for a table, we were a party of three, the waitress had no control over what was going on and appeared to care even less. It was a mess -after an hour we were starving so we left without getting a table, we told the waitress we were giving up and she seemed to have no idea  that we'd been standing there for an hour. I put it down to a bad day but I went back and it was a similar experience-hopefully they sort out their service soon."
/user_details?userid=mLmgtTwuryDjJAQrSZ_w5w,Karina W.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I don't know if I could write a fair review based on having had one hot chocolate there, so please proceed with caution. I went with a girlfriend on a Friday night. We got there at about 8.15, so we only had 45 minutes before they closed. The waitress was really, really friendly and we didn't feel like she wanted to kick our butts out when it was nearly 9 either. The decor is adorable. Lots of hanging lightbulbs placed in proximity with each other somehow create a pleasant effect. Very artsy indeed. The vintage wood chairs and tables only add to the charm. I like! However, the hot chocolate was disappointing. First it wasn't warm enough, so it was hard to get those sugar cubes to dissolve. Second, the taste just didn't cut it. Nowhere near what can be called hearty and full-bodied as what hot chocolates should be. I would go back though, for sure. Just not for the hot chocolate."
