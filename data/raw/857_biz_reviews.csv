/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Isle de Garde is currently canning and selling their beers due to covid-19. I had never tried their beer before so we purchased a variety to try at home. So far I love how smooth their beers are and how the design of their cans are bright and fun. I prefer fruity sour beers so my favorite so far is their 'Gose Pêches'.If you like Isle de Garde, stop by and grab some beers!"
/user_details?userid=oGL9JE09OHEJMxpY4ma7tg,David P.,"Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I like this place a lot. Great ambiance and great staff. They have an ever-changing selection of draft beer to fit every taste and will be happy to help you choose a beverage that you like. As for food, I am sad to say I have had better experience.I ordered the duck breast which was the plat du jour. The plate looked amazing but I found the duck to be a little too chewy and greasy. I could see the alcohol pooling on my plate. Also, the food wasn't very hot in general. It is not my first time at Isle de garde and I know they can make amazing food so I won't let this bad experience stop me from going there for the atmosphere and the beer."
/user_details?userid=o_IEnOVNuir0QNVkANzyXQ,Esteban Y.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Their IPA is absolutely amazing. They change their menu very often, and I have been 3 times here and all the time their food is absolutely amazing. The kitchen closes pretty late so it is a good place to go and eat when it is late and you really want some good quality food."
/user_details?userid=qZn4-4_ApTfiJHRTSwJAlQ,Sylvain P.,"Victoria, Canada",4 star rating,Good pub were you can drink tasty beers and good meals. I tasted a german tasting beer and a cossette (in honor of singer Sylvain Cosette) and they were excellent beers. In my group of people almost everybody likes theur beers.I taste the samuel l Jackson burger who is tasty with bacon. Located in nice quarter near plaza St-hubert terasse are nice when it's sunny.Bon pub ou vous pouvez boire d'excellentes bières maison. J'ai bu une bière d'inspiration germanique qui etait très gouteuse avec du bacon.  et aussi  la. Cosette ( en l'honneur de Sylvain Cosette !). Et c'était d'excellentes bières de micro brasseries.J'ai mangé le burger Samuel L Jackson qui est gouteux avec du bacon.Situé dans Rosemont près de la plaxa St-Hubert la terasse est bien lorsque le soleil se montre le bout du nez.
/user_details?userid=pQHI4jeu4gKEV4lK5tsmQg,Spencer J.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"People are under-selling the burger (what the hell is 'too heavy' anyways, it's a burger!). I was impressed. This is a seriously good burger, perfect char grilled flavor with a bacon, pickle, cheese combo that was en fuego. Up there with Toussignant as the best burger I've had in Montreal, and this place has an unbelievable selection of beers on tap! The gnocchi, taquitos, and charcuterie plate were also very good, especially the latter."

The place was full but not packed. Note that you'll share personal space with quite a number of people no matter which ever way you slice it.The ambiance is casual but come 7pm they dim the lights and it's very cute :) The menu leans very vegetarian/vegan with a couple of meat offerings. My date is a devout carnivore so he went for their burger. He wasn't too pleased that the burger came with coleslaw and he had to order a side of fries if he wanted to eat some. It was good, but messy and he found the burger was too heavy..I decided to take a gamble: vegan sheppard's pie! I lost that gamble so bad it's not even funny. The menu said ""tempeh, squash puree etc.."" so I don't know what i was expecting...Actually, I was expecting it to be hot (it wasn't), and to be a hearty, filling meal which was a lost cause since they do this thing where they bring out massive plates with only a small recess in the middle where your food will sit, taunting you.. It was tasty, don't get me wrong, but it was also an appetizer that costs a meal's price. When I asked what the dessert was and the waitress mentioned it being ""deconstructed"" I bailed.I haven't lost hope as far as Isle de Garde is concerned, their most expensive dishes seem fun, so I'll keep that in mind, who knows.."

Nice casual feel about this place and talking with my friends who are local, it's  packed on most nights! Worth the wait though. I had their charcuterie plate and it was awesome. The only thing that I didn't get was an explanation of what was on my plate but it all tasted great!"

/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great place for after work drinks, drinks with friends or a date with that special someone. It may sound strange, but this bar has a romantic vibe to it. The atmosphere is nice and the service is good. Their selection of beer is nice too. Definitely a place worth a visit."
/user_details?userid=AX7PN-tAH5vUO5KRbKEVZQ,Matthieu P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"L'isle de garde c'est un peu devenu mon QG à force d'y aller. En même temps le lieu est pas mal situé proche du metro beaubien.L'endroit est grand mais je crois que je n'ai pas eu une seule fois sans devoir attendre pour avoir une place...et oui c'est souvent complet donc il est préférable d'arriver tôt ou de réserver mais je ne sais pas si c'est possible. Une fois installé c'est largement mieux, vous avez un large choix de bières qui change régulièrement. Les différents serveurs connaissent bien leur sujet et sont de bon conseil si vous ne savez pas quoi choisir. Je crois que je n'ai jamais été déçu par leurs conseils. Maintenant ils font même leur propre bière mais je n'ai pas encore testé.Coté nourriture c'est pareil il y a un large choix mais je dois avouer que le burger est bon et que les frites sont à tomber.... Je pense que je les prends à chaque fois !J'ai hâte de pouvoir tester leur terrasse cet été même si je pense qu'elle ne sera pas trop calme vu la circulation sur la rue beaubien.Pour information ce n'est pas le meilleur endroit pour aller voir un match de Hockey, je pense que ce n'est pas leur priorité."
/user_details?userid=l5QUFf1R8FnvYivAigOAiA,Jillian G.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"A great local brewery to check out if you're in the area!It's cozy but homey. Our party of 2 was seated by the windows in a small corner. Even so, we felt the warmness and community of the restaurant throughout the evening. Our waitress was great, she struggled to explain some of the French dishes to us in english, but we enjoyed everything that she suggested and she never kept us waiting. The beer list is organized from lightest to darkest, convenient for those who may only know that they don't like dark beers or only want the darkest of the dark. I actually went with the komboucha on tap. It was great, a perfect combo of bitter & sweet. I later found out this komboucha is local to montreal & is sold in most retail locations too. Made me like it even more! For dinner, I got the tarte tatin de tomates confites. Talk about cheesy goodness! It was basically cheese, tomato & balsamic reduction on a sweet bread. Incredibly decadent. My boyfriend got the Samuel Jackson burger, which was good, but nothing out of this world. We also shared a side salad that was packed full of arugula & had a nice dressing that wasn't too overpowering. Overall this is a great decision if you're looking for a local joint. It's right next to the metro too."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"Updating because of a few important things I didn't know about on my first visits: like many of my favourite bars and restaurants in this city there are no televisions. As someone who didn't grow up with one I find the flickering allure of the screen impossible to look away from and for me it's a conversation killer. BUT, the other half of the classically genius Quebec equation is this: a TV, or in this case a projector and big screen, materializes when the Habs play. Isle de Garde play the game without sound so it doesn't take over, but you can keep up with everybody's favourite Canadiens. Also: they have a sandwich that is mac and cheese inside a grilled cheese. Those are my important updates."

/user_details?userid=oZTw7RE95YAK6akfBq9W-g,Geoff S.,"Edmonton, Canada",3 star rating,"Honestly, the service here is a atrocious. It's like they have made bad service a cool, hip thing. Anyways - the beer and food is so good I still come here regularly but I hate myself for it every time."
/user_details?userid=FmbduNxDfGN7TiHrY2UewA,Souvina G.,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",5 star rating,"A sweet spot in the Beaubien area of Montréal. This place is a blessing for the palate, some seriously well crafted beers, great selection and staff who know their stuff... Combined with simple but yet warm and comforting food. I tried their Mac and cheese, cold meat platter and pogo and all were to die for. We were lucky to get a table as this brasserie gets busy quickly... So try and get in early!"
/user_details?userid=Rq8m7cL8SG7mYgNvOXq80w,Marine B.,"Paris, France",3 star rating,"I was a bit disappointed by this bar. They have a great selection of beers, and they do flights. I don't remember the prices exactly but I believe they were average for the beer, quite high for the food. However, two bad points: 1) Service was very, very inexperienced. The bartender waited 20 minutes before taking our order, then forget the order and came back for us to re-order, and finally wasn't sure of which beer was which in the flight we ordered. C'mon people. 2) The cocktails are not very good - I asked for a ti'punch (it's a pretty simple recipe though...) and got rhum with wayyyyy too much lemon but wayyyy not enough sugar. It was the most acidic drink I've ever had!"
/user_details?userid=zNPEn4aHT7qQjki2q0QkWg,Nicole R.,"Lakewood, OH",5 star rating,We stopped in on a very rainy day. We had 2 excellent beers and the cheese plate. I asked the waiter for a suggestion of beer and he was spot on! Great atmosphere!
/user_details?userid=h_DhHLKqZL30C-QO7G0LyA,Kristen G.,"Dripping Springs, TX",5 star rating,"Came here on recommendation from my Airbnb hosts, and I'm certainly glad that I did! I love the ambiance of the place - busy, but with mood lighting and lovely art on the walls. Had some of the house beer and it was delicious and tastefully brewed. I just had to try the Samuel L. Jackson burger (I'm a sucker for themes), and it was delicious! The slaw was unexpected, but actually a great accompaniment to the huge burger they served. Overall, I loved it, both the food and the experience!"

Place was packed, we decided to leave. Needs to hire a host to handle waiting customers."
/user_details?userid=sHdl6YWEd5FGp52F6HoQwA,Tyson A.,"Hilo, HI",4 star rating,"Decided to stop by, and check out their large house made beer selection, and a quick bite for lunch. Speaking only English myself,  the staff generously helped translate the menu. Had a sampler of three beers, and can say were all quite good."
/user_details?userid=-AMCsAcvnZ55HVAQd33oUQ,Mort A.,"Madrid, Spain",4 star rating,"First of all, the service is AMAZING, the waiting staff is very friendly and I consider that a super plus!The food is good, there's not much to choose for vegetarians like me, but there are some good things, apparently the mac & cheese is supergood (my boyfriend and friends had it and loved it).There are a LOT of beers, and the waiting staff will help you choose depending on what you like, which is very helpful, as I said, awesome waiting staff.There is KOMBUCHA! And I love Kombucha! I've never seen a bar/pub serving Kombucha at night time, so that made my day!! And it is very good!Prices are ok, for the food maybe a little bit expensive, but OK in general :)I really want to go back!!!"
/user_details?userid=NuIgNf7rSABI6RRZIh0kPQ,Sebastien C.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"Great place to go if you're interested in sampling some of the many interesting local varieties of beer Quebec has to offer, as they have an impressive and ever changing selection of them on tap. Warning:  The default side dish for their burgers and sandwiches is a salad."
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Isle de garde entered my list of new bars I needed to visit urgently as soon I read the review from Karine S. Expectations have been set high and satisfied well by the extensive choice of local beers. We, the ""old"" people, arrived around 7pm on Saturday and the bar was already packed, but we managed to get our own spot of counter type in the second room. Later during the night when the ""young"" population of Montreal infiltrated the bar, people would be just standing up and drinking. The bar offers also nice list of food options. I had the marinated pork tongue, served in a jar with toasted baguette and mustard, delicious snack for good brew. Service is great. The guys handled very professionally the concern that the second pint of the smoky PunkRaugh lager didn't taste the same, may be they did a mistake when I just ordered ""the same"" or they just changed the keg, but they brought immediately a small tasting glass and substituted the pint in question. Besides that I enjoyed the floor in the bathrooms, which is of numismatic value. Ultimately, I'm happy to see another bar, where I can explore the amazing Quebec beers!"

The beer selection was phenomenal and the staff was very helpful with questions and requests. Our party of five did not have the chance to eat here, but it did look good! If you are in the neighborhood definitely stop in!"
/user_details?userid=IIVkudpMg0aTCHSLGCcaqw,Jeremias O.,"Nurmijärvi, Finland",5 star rating,"Absolute 5/5. We went in boldly as a group of 6, even though the place was packed (as usual). The staff was very friendly and managed to squeeze us in after like 45 minutes, which was nice considering the time. I ordered the BBQ ribs with russel sprouts - so far the best meal I've had in Montreal. I also like the fact that even though it was a little noisy because of the chatter, the music wasn't that loud (as it is in most places). All of us had a really positive experience and everyone enjoyed their meals. Considering the quality of the food, the prices are actually pretty reasonable."

She is speedy, has it together with grace and a smile, and switches from English to French at the drop of a hat, even with the noise or music climbing in volume. A great place for Happy Hour. I really recommend the Grilled cheese Mac n Cheese and the Veggie Chili. The beer selection is extensive and the Bourbonade just deeelish. We went here on a couple of Thursday happy hours as well as a Saturday night dinner and had the best food and service consistently. Very happy this exists."

/user_details?userid=ProY_s1duhihnD2IHV8gWQ,Michael D.,"Northampton, MA",5 star rating,My honey and I came here on a whim. It was a Saturday night and packed. The waitress was cute and told us there is no waiting list just grab a spot when someone leaves. She did escort us to a corner to a standing shelf so we could order beer. The beer selection was great and not overwhelming.  We were able to grab seats before we finished our first beers. The place was filled with hipsters and beer lovers. It was loud but we could still talk without yelling.  Food was great.  Service was great. The staff knows beer. A wonderful find. Worth the wait. Worth a visit
/user_details?userid=hoaC_7QwAfs4GQCrL8HUlA,Daniel P.,"Longueuil, Canada",4 star rating,"Very interesting place if you want to have access to a large selection of beers from Quebec or taste some of their own beers developed in partnership with craftbrewers. The selection of food is also interesting, ranging from basic munchies up to complete course. Took the burger. The meat was juicy, tasty and well seasoned. The burger was looking like those home-made burgers made over the BBQ. Really delicious."
