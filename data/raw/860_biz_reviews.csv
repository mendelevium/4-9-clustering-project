I have not tried the duck here as recommended but I can vouch for the deep fried calamari and the prawns. VERY delicious....I would definitely come back, as it is reasonably priced."
/user_details?userid=RX9MH2jHaK90KF-2rU9Mvg,Selena C.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"Was visiting the area and wanted some chinese food and we thought this would be okay. It wasn't that great. The restaurant was mostly empty and food seemed really greasy. But we were tourists and pretty hungry after a lot of walking around the city and exploring so we did eat it. The vegetables were not washed properly. There was sand settlement at the bottom of the plate when the vegetables were moved around. We had to rinse some florets in a bowl of water to make sure we weren't seeing things. We complained to the server who didn't seem to acknowledge that at first, and then finally gave us a new plate of other vegetables but with a side of attitude.Wouldnt recommend for tourists. They were happily having a conversation with a large table next to us (which I assumed were regulars there)."
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"My dining experience abstract keywords: takeout Chinese. I was told that Beijing is one of the older Chinese restaurants known for its late night post clubbing pit stop food.  There were a lot of people dining, as two people we were directed to sit right in front of the kitchen doors in the back. We asked to move up front- my friend was able to grab a server's attention with great difficulty but we made it! Considering the large selection of items - we opted for a dinner for 2 option on the menu that was roughly 40$. This option included wonton soup (3/5), egg rolls (1/5), pineapple chicken (2/5), chicken fried rice (3/5), honey garlic spareribs (1/5), Cantonese chow mein (3/5). My deal: everything was served cold and stale with the exception of the soup. Usually I take home leftovers but the leftovers this time went straight to the bin! Am I going to be picky about this place ? No, because you pay for the takeout Chinese experience, but there is definitively better options for Chinese takeout if you really want to honour your cravings!"
/user_details?userid=1KNqO6peolVhRHIEum2yZg,Ronen L.,"Dollard-Des Ormeaux, Canada",1 star rating,"We ordered 3 things, wonton soup, General Tao chicken and orange beef. What we got was, dough in liquid, chicken skin/fat in fried dough, and more skin/fat in dough.The wonton was literally rolled dough with barely any meat if any inside. I took a bite and you can see the dough rolled. From my experience wonton is supposed to be dough surrounding a piece of meat.The general Tao was pieces of chicken fat or chicken skin or just plain fried dough.Same thing with the orange beef.I just paid 45$ for fried dough, chicken skin/fat, & beef fat, don't think there was any meat in my order.I'm never going to step foot in that restaurant!"

Service was very good. The Beijing rice was very yummy. The meat in the beef with XO sauce dish required a LOT of chewing. The veggies in the fish fillet with vegetables dish also required substantial chewing. If my jaws did not have to work so hard, I might have given this place 4 instead of 3 stars!"
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"We were craving some late night eats after a night out at Beer Festival. Perfect how Chinatown is just around the corner. There were three restaurant still open on a late Thursday evening but we settled on Beijing. I've been here at least once or twice back in the day. Menu is typical Chinese style with 225 options. There's also some specials plastered along the walls in English, French and Chinese characters. Service is fast and our food followed quickly. - Beef chow ho (#196) ($10.95) - a staple but you can never go wrong ordering it. Satisfying. - Sweet & sour chicken with ginger ($13.95) - more sweet than sour, this is pretty much Chinese Canadian style. Average. - Young chow fried rice (#169) ($9.95) - good wok hay. Don't expect anything special but it's perfect for late night eats. Open till 3:00am!"

I ordered sesame beef and it was crunchy and yummy. Too sweet towards the end as I ate the whole dish by myself. The price is okay - not on the cheap side of the spectrum.

We were surprised when the good came out 2 minutes after us ordering. Our chicken smelled like ""dirty socks"" and was cold. I would bet my life the food was prepared a week earlier. Our tea cups were stained with food residue. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE they should be shut down"
/user_details?userid=uaT4DQ440pSYYE1CHqKqXQ,Asam S.,"Baltimore, MD",1 star rating,"If I could give this 0 stars, I would. Vegetarian egg roll was soaked in oil and tasteless. The wonton soup was watery and similarly tasteless. They brought out duck sauce which was ALSO watered down and tasteless. Why didn't I leave? I keep asking myself that... maybe I was overly optimistic. Maybe I was lazy and did not want to get up. I ate a few of the Szechuan shrimp I got and now have a HORRIBLE stomach ache. My husband got a half of a BBQ duck which was burnt to a crisp. The manager then claimed that this is how fried duck tastes. Yes, you read correctly. He said it was fried when the menu said BBQ. Go up the block. There are better restaurants with better service."

Good grub, and fast quick service. The waiter sized me up and suggested a beef noodles with black bean dish so I obliged. We ordered the lobster with ginger and scallions, it was great and only about $20. We also ordered seafood fried rice. Big portions, opens late and everything looked good coming out of the kitchen"
/user_details?userid=9bvlW5Gos1kxzvcM3c-12w,Don P.,"Hampden County, MA",4 star rating,"Wouldn't dream of not stopping here as they have one of the best Hot and Sour soups on the planet, consistently good from visit to visit, year after year. This time I went with the General Tso's Chicken, egg roll and white rice which is distinctly different from the States, not cloying sweet and gooped up as you might be use to in our own Chinese American restaurants. Even the egg roll is different in texture and taste all in a very good way. The show stopper was the Dou Miao, stir fried pea shoots in a very light garlic sauce, oh my goodness such a delicate flavor and taste. Restaurant Beijing does many other authentic Chinese dishes and I have always been more than pleased when stopping by for either lunch or dinner."

/user_details?userid=6NohyUDQXB0w7B-ZSkHQbQ,Boze H.,"Vancouver, Canada",1 star rating,"Unfortunately, my experience at the restaurant was unpleasant to say the least. When we ordering, the server must not have heard us adjust our order and ended up bringing us a dish we no longer wanted. Evidently, their problem solving skills amounted to shoving it on the table without any apology and just insisting that we take it. And throughout the course of our supper, not once did anyone offer to come by and change our plates, in spite of the fact that by the end of our meal, all of the many bland tastes had unfortunately blended together into one gigantically bland soupy mess. Needless to say, we were glad to reinforce that gratuities are not mandatory for clearly subpar service."

We were so lucky to stumble onto this place while visiting Montreal and staying at the Intercontinental. Beijing is walking distance in the heart of Chinatown (right at the corner of the Chinois alley). Make the walk!Everything they make is precision. The egg rolls and spring rolls were irresistible. The cashew chicken was yummy. Best of all, I loved their fried rice entrees. Every night, we tried a different plate - both the beef fried rice and the seafood pork plate tasted smoky, savory and outstanding.Open till 3 AM and filled with Asian customers, this is the real deal!"

My husband had the most delicious Hot & Sour Soup. We wanted to  take some home to our local takeout joint and say....Make this! Mushrooms and tofu and real pork and shrimp (gasp!) I don't even like Hot & Sour Soup and I was stealing bites. I had an eggroll. You could tell it was handmade and handrolled. It was crispy and wonderful. I had General Tso's Chicken since that is my Chinese jam. It was great. Not the sickening sweet stuff of home. Just good crispy and slight spicy and sweet. The house fried rice was the average dish of the night.A great place in Chinatown!"

The restaurant is vast and the host is friendly. However it takes so long for the food to arrive, I also noticed that some people were not pleased due to parking spots and the food wasn't ready by a certain time! Quite frustrating. In addition, after 15-20 minutes, the food arrived and it was cold and not good! I ordered chicken fried rice and Chinese brocoli. I didn't like it at all. Spent $25 for nothing. Not worth it :/  and I'd never return, the service is so slow and the food was such a disappointment."

I am not sure who was working the stove yesterday but they definitely didn't take any care in making my noodles as 3/4 were either overcooked or burnt. Who would is serve black, dry noodles to a customer for $10.95. Thank goodness my sister's meal was decent, so I didn't starve. Not the worst chinese food ever because I didn't throw it up, but disappointing beyond belief."

If you're craving the standard fare, North Americanized version of Chinese food, this is your spot. The hot and sour soup was great. Small size is a large bowl which is nice. Tofu was okay. You can ask for chili oil which makes everything nice.Service is okay, food is okay, prices are okay. Nothing to chirp home about."

Had to ask for attention and service despite few occupied tables. Beef was good, but the veggie hot pot was bland.  Asked for chili oil and the waiter pointed to the generic red sauce that looked like ketchup.  As a parting shot, they included the tip in the charge even though we were only a party of 3. It's Montreal, there's so many better options even just down the block in Chinatown.   Skip this one."

I was happy to see this restaurant open late and glad that they had what I was looking for.I ordered the bbq pork appetizer with the shrimp and corn soup. What is the definition of full? That soup. I was handed a bowl 2 times the size of my head with a lot of broth. I was a little disappointed with the noodles because they were thinner then I expected. Also the pork was a little dry but it's based with a sauce which you can put on to help.Overall this seems like a good place to get that crave. I hope when it's busy the food is a bit better but I was still happy when I left.Enjoy!

You have to know what the hell you are doing or you will fail and choose the ""trap"" items. Make sure you study reviews ahead of time to know what to order. Another option is to creep on the people who are eating while walking to your table and hope you can figure out what they have. I'm pretty sure there's a secret menu if you can speak Chinese.The black bean clams were legit. I can't remember what else we got, but the noodles were fresh and we enjoyed most things, but were increasingly jealous as we saw amazing options walking past us. This place is kind of a neat mash-up of authentic chinese and westernized chinese take out."

The waiter told us that it was seasonal. When the final bill came we were shocked that the vegetables alone were $27. You would think that when something's in season it's not exorbitantly expensive, however this place doesn't play by these rules. Don't go out of your way to eat here"

The server described Soo Guy as a 'special Asian sauce"" . . .UH, your typical sweet and sour sauce is not what I would call ""special"". . . sorry, didn't like it one bit. The spicy beef had a bit of flavor, but that was only because we asked for it to come out ""SUPER"" spicy. . .

I come from Vancouver where we have a very very large Chinese population, so I compare my experiences from Asian restaurants there.Great food and good service for an Asian restaurant. There's a difference in service by cultural standards, so most western people don't understand that their food may come out at different times and to share their plates family style. We had some wonton soup, egg rolls, chow mein, a beef dish and the boneless crispy fried chicken. The wonton broth was SO light and delicious, no scum or floaties, talk about quality, and the wontons were nice and light. Egg Roll was properly fried and not greasy.  Same with the chicken.The other dishes came with nice fresh vegetables and were great portions, exactly what I would expect.

We washed the above average food down with Tsing Tao. The food was hot, tasty and they made sure that no peanuts were present for our one diner who was allergic. Of course we ordered far too much food but that was intentional so that the student at our table had leftovers. For me Chinese food is a simple combination of freshness, look and taste. Crispy should be crispy - it was, green should be green - very, and it should all be tasty - not just salty - check!This is not fancy schmancy nouvelle cuisine chinoise - it is good, tasty chinese food at a reasonable price."

We were walk-ins, and there were no free tables and nowhere to sit and wait, but the host gave us a number and a time at which to come back, so we got to wander around Chinatown for a while before our meal. It was nice to have a set time as opposed to being at the beck and call of a buzzer system. When we returned (10 minutes early), we were immediately seated. We ended up ordering a dinner for two, which included some delicious won ton soup, the best egg rolls I've ever had (very different than the standard cooked-from-frozen), and three entrees. It's been a couple months since we were there, but I specifically remember the honey garlic short ribs being amazing. The meal wasn't too expensive, and for what we paid we ended up with far more food than what we could finish at the table. Definitely a good value.I'm hoping to make a return visit here next time I'm in Montreal."

Chinatown is packed with of course great options to eat out but this restaurant has earned its reputation of being one of the best ones in the town so you can see by the line up outside. Anyway I always come here for their beef tranch fries... Its not really listed in the menu, but you can always ask the waiter for salt and pepper beef with no sauce, or even customize any dish. Really. They have a potluck service going on so everyone is always helping your table not matter what and you wont feel left behind at all. I loved how my particular who made a point on smiling and nodding everytime he passed and asked if everything was okay, making sure he was attentive. And this happens consistently everytime I come here, any given time. The food itself is great! As a regular I always get the beef that I was talking about the corn chicken creamy soup and 2 sides that I always change around. One of my fav here is the cantonese fried chowmein. Its crispy with enough chicken around. Overall its great here to come check out after your done sight seeing chinatown or down walk from st laurent street :)"

But last time we ordered it, the sauce was almost hoisin and soy sauce. Really bad. Not to mention clams were so much overcooked and not hot unlike before. The possibility that the dish was reheated leftover makes me feel awful. Also waiter didn't do anything but saying, ""there are 3-4 cooks always in the kitchen."" Hmm what does it have to do with overcooked hoisin clams..? Disappointing service."
/user_details?userid=cXciolQyHZiW3uAB_dgPuQ,Ian L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"After years of hearing about this place, I finally decided to go with my wife and parents for dinner and we were not disappointed.We showed up around 6:30pm, the restaurant was already pretty full. We were asked if we had reservations, we said we did not and the guy walked over to a table with a reserved sign on it and seated us. We were brought Chinese tea with our menus. The tea was surprisingly good. I find the tea served in most Chinese restaurants to be flavorless and glorified pale colored water, however this tea was full of flavor and was a welcome change.Once seated, we begin to look over their menu. There is plenty to choose from and there is something for everyone's taste and their menu has one of the largest selection of vegetarian options available that I have ever seen and was more than just something and tofu as you find in most places. We spent a few minutes picking our dishes and the waiter came over, confirmed everything with me about what I had written.My wife ordered a wonton soup, but it was enough for the both of us. My parents ordered a small Hot & Sour soup, that was more than enough for the both of them. Our main course consisted of General Tao Chicken, Shrimp Chop Suey, Seafood Fried Rice, Beef Chow Ho, and my father got a bowl of steamed rice.My mother was worried we didn't order enough, but than again she's always worried there will not be enough food. However, there was more than enough to go around and at the end of the meal, it was more gluttony that was making me pick at the plates, than anything else.My favorite dish was the Beef Chow Ho, it had a beautiful smoky taste to it, that was absolutely divine. The Seafood Fried rice was made up of small scallops, shrimp, and what seemed to be mock crab. The General Tao was good, but it could have been a little spicier for my taste, but it was nicely cooked and not soft and mushy like I have had at other places.All in all, for the four of us, with 4 Tsingtao beers, with tax and tip it came to just under 90$. If we hadn't had the beers, the price would have been a lot more reasonable, because the beers alone were 23$. The service was quick and the food was great. All in all, I look forward to my next visit to try some of the dishes I saw at other tables while I was walking out."

The food here isn't always to my taste but that's more of a preference thing then a quality of food thing. I like Beijing because the menu has a wide variety of dishes, a little something for everyone, whether you want the old standards like General Tao chicken and chicken fried rice to pickled cabbage and vegetarian hot pots.The decor is standard old School Chinese restaurant chairs and tables out of the 70's, waiving cats and half the menu written on pieces of cardboard taped to the wall.  Until recently the menu items on the wall were only written in Chinese. The dated decor give along with the divers clientele give Restaurant Beijing a great ambiance.This restaurant won't disappoint, if you're looking for a good Chinese restaurant then Beijing should be on your list of places to try."

Some of the best Chinese I've had.Hot and Sour Soup: This was the only disappointment. It was overly thick and lacked flavor.Soft Shell Crab with Pepper: Perfectly cooked and delicious.Egg Roll: The best egg roll that I've ever had. Crispy with fantastic fillings. The homemade sweet and sour sauce is wonderful.Dumplings with Peanut Sauce: These were very delicate, though the peanut sauce was a bit heavy and lacked the flavor of Thai peanut sauces.General Tao Tofu: Cubes of fresh tofu surrounded by an amazing golden, deep fried dough and a tasty sauce.Szechuan Fish: This was not what I was expecting, but was still great. Lightly breaded but fresh fish in a sweet and spicy sauce with crispy green pepper and onion. Normally I think green pepper is a waste of time, but this balanced the sweetness of the sauce and the dough nicely.Service: Fine. Friendly and prompt, though my fiance did have to order his beer twice.Ambiance: Lively (in a good way) but otherwise average."

Food tastes bad, service is not better than the food... nothing else to say. I will never come to this place again!! 黑椒牛柳根本不是柳 一大块一大块肉不切 上面还有血 服务员说牛肉有血很正常！各种不好吃 服务态度差！"

We got a large multiple course meal that was both celebratory and delicious. Although the weather was very rainy, the food kept us warm and comfy. They could use a bit of an upgrade in decor, but overall it was a nice meal."

/user_details?userid=zgqi7Ryo7L5VTKonEVkRwQ,L C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5 star rating,"I have been going to this place since I was wee and it has always been good. Although my horizons have been broadened by SGV, I have to say that this will be the standard by which other chinese food is measured (ie. is it absolutely positively delicious). We always start out with seafood bean curd soup (what we always referred to as Pa Bo Bean Curd Soup and chinese won ton soup...since we have been going here for almost 30 years, not sure whether this is the correct name or just tolerance on their part)...just perfect with a little siracha. Then comes the onslaught of dishes including ginger lobster, beef with thick rice noodles in black bean sauce, steamed sole with ginger and shallots, shrimps with lobster sauce, snow pea leaves, watercress, baby bak choy, and a few random dishes we may try. This place is a must for me...one of the places that makes Montreal home and I never miss a chance to eat here when I am back in town. This place is definitely not for those on a diet cos they are not shy with the oil it seems...but worth every bite!  There is only street parking and it is limited so be warned if you try to come here on a busy day like Xmas or weekends, etc. As well, street parking is now $6 for 2 hours (!!!!!)...the only saving grace to this travesty by the idiotic councilmembers is that you can use your credit or debit card to pay. Other than that, I'm just gonna rant a little about the morally reprehensible device employed by the municipal council to maximize their revenue, only to misuse the funds in such imbecilic maneuvers as ""renaming all the english streets into french names"". Instead of using the money to fix the streets, there are giant, extremely hazardous potholes everywhere so that the overpaid, extremely bored councilmembers can come up with other useless measures in a bid to rid the city of all traces of english. Unfortunately, in their bid to preserve the french language, they ensure its demise; who wants to keep around a language whose speakers are so annoying?"

We had soup, rice and noodles and everything was very good. service was quick and pleasant although somewhat businesslike. Prices were cheap too (less than $ 30 for lots of food that we had to take home). I'd come here again."
