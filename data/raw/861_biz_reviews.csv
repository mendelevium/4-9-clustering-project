/user_details?userid=l2KQ6jm88t_tT7LLdxpuvA,Danny M.,"Candiac, Canada",5 star rating,"Such a cozy warm welcoming little coffee shop. Not expensive at all compared to Starbucks! The espresso was a good one and the hot chocolate was a regular hot chocolate which tasted like hot chocolate! But the fun part is the little detail! Decors! Little bit of chocolate sprinkles forming hearts, floating above the foamy hot chocolate. How can you not have a smile on your face while drinking your cup??? If you're looking for fancy stuff, go elsewhere. But if you're looking for good drinks and simple snacks at a low price range, then you've come to the right place!Beware! There are not that many seats, so if you come during exam seasons, good luck!"

It's a sunny, airy place with cute chairs. The coffee is served in bright yellow cups, sprinkled with chocolate in a heart shape. They also have a garden but we sat indoors. The barista was also very friendly and welcoming."

/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Location: On the Plateau. If you're using transit and get off at Mont-Royal, it's about 10-minutes away on foot. Street parking available but in short supply.The place: Tucked away on a quiet street, this café is small and offers up a bright but minimalistic decor. Brick walls, large window, wood - it's got a very cottage feel to it that I like. A few tables and a couch are available to its patrons.The coffee: They use 49th Parallel beans which I'm generally a fan of (think Old School Espresso), but I wasn't that crazy about the latté I ordered. It was too bitter for my taste and I've had tastier coffee using the same beans at Myriade, and at home (hey, I'm no barista - I'm just saying'). They also offer some baked goods that looked quite tasty, but I wasn't hungry enough to try anything this time around. Service: A little chilly. The woman who served us wasn't exactly brimming with energy or friendliness - something I would expect from a neighbourhood coffee shop. The fellow who showed up later, however, seemed friendlier and he took the time to chit chat two customers who left me with the impression that they'd never ordered coffee before. It was a big production for something so basic, but dude was cool about it and gave them some suggestions.Price point: Average. I think the latté was about $4."
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Charming little cafe that has good coffee, pastries, nice panini and it appears yummy gaufrettes. Besides that they will squeeze some fresh juice for you or you can try some artizanal ice cream if in mood. This adorable coffee shop is so well hidden from the hustle and bustle of the main streets of Plateau. Relaxed and refreshing, people sitting in the small patio and chatting over the wooden tables about big and small things of life: tango, food and who knows what else..... Sweet!"

/user_details?userid=Zv_rMzv_8-c2-g0WtEXlTg,Bruno P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very special taste. The latte was really nice. I was planning to go somewhere else, but the place was packed so I've found this precious small café. Lucky me! Very silent and calm place. Excellent for those who goes for reading. Not all seat are allowed to use laptop! The decoration is amazing and fun at same time. I tried a chai gluten free cookie. (I like to try different things). Worth coming back!"

Quite close to Parc Lafontaine, it is a popular café and many people come around 2-5PM, they can play games like poker or Monopoly or Scrabble there. The terrace is the most unique one I have ever seen, with a wood structure with plenty of colourful cushions. The café has light music and many bubbly white lantern balls suspending from the rooftop, I love it!"

/user_details?userid=9yzHD0x5srYlHBbuJROWFg,Katie R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Super cute cafe nestled in the backstreets of the Plateau. The decor is charming, with a cozy sofa for lounging and two big tables for sharing, paper lanterns and little sparrow-themed decorations throughout. There's not much seating, but the space is bright and welcoming, and the bathroom is a chalkboard of cheery phrases. On the back counter are magazines for reading, and kids' toys to entertain the little'uns.Food is good, coffee is good, space is delightful."
/user_details?userid=sOL82Hbfza89tKL6m_wBJA,Marie H V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Really good latte. For baked goods, it depends on what you pick. The pistachio croissant is delicious, the chocolatine is ok. The inside is pretty and stylish; it has some toys for kids. The patio is pretty large and SO nice in the summer time. See the picture I posted, really pretty, and quiet. The lady working there helped me get out with the stroller, latte, and food; it was nice of her. I like the relaxed atmosphere of this side-street cafe."

People are friendly and so is the staff. I got their veg panini and soup. Food is great! Totally would come back again, in the sring/summer this time :P"
/user_details?userid=u0FUxx_5a3BK6UnG81A_yA,Sohail M.,"Ottawa, Canada",1 star rating,"Summary: Arrogant, cold, rude lady behind the counter made it a terrible experience. After reading other reviews it seems I'm not the only one. I love indie coffee shops and visit them all over the world, I've never had such a bad experience. I ordered a cappuccino and was given a 'latte' with almost no foam. I'm not an expert but I'm well experienced with cappuccinos and know what to expect. When I told her it was made like a latte and I'd like it with more foam she said ""that's how we make them here, we don't do foam"". Even if I was wrong (which I wasn't) or being difficult, her attitude was unapologetic and agressive. Totally unacceptable for a cute neighbourhood coffee shop which is supposed to be a happy place. With so many amazing options in MTL no reason to go here."
/user_details?userid=A7YlcidsiAZzU-tCSsrTSg,Anny T.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"A few more days before the end of the Indie Cafe Passport, I've made a stop by this cafe in the plateau.Good : the latte art is done pretty well. The decor is cute with a bunch of lanterns hanging over the tables with a welcoming atmosphere. However, that welcoming atmosphere ends as soon as you hit the counter to order your drink.Bad: *sigh* I did enjoy my first trip to this cafe with my sister, but when I went back today, I received a very cold service. I ordered a cup of tea to go, and I've asked for a bit of ice in it (I'm not patient, I want to sip right away so i need my tea to be ""drinkable"" hot ). She responded by saying they don't have ice. Fine, I've asked for a bit cold water to dilute the hot water. She tells me she can't. Huh? I told her it's too hot, I can't drink this. In her most condescending voice, she tells me that I have to wait 3 minutes to steep the tea and then I can drink it (as in I can't decide what goes in my tea, but my tea decides when I can drink it?). Already this attitude was irritating for me, but whatever. I picked up my tea cup (to go) & realized it's so ridiculously hot, I can't even hold it. I turn around and asked if I can get a sleeve or another cup to put over it. She looks at me hesitantly as if I really inconvenienced her and gives me a few napkins to wrap around. Maybe if she added some cold water as I've requested, it wouldn't be so damn hot and I wouldn't have to ask for a cup. I've already felt irritated leaving the cafe with my cup of liquid devil, but when I spilt tea on my hand and it burned me, I've completely lost it. I don't ever want a barista to convince me of how I want my drinks again. Bottom line: after that crappy service, I will probably come back once every never."
/user_details?userid=rFUE7QepJaxOpQsb40c9hw,Catherine D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Cute neighbourhood cafe. The cold brew was super good (I tasted a bit of mapple syrup... Might have been in my head but anyways, it was good). The decor is super nice and cozy. The service though... Oh boy. Whoever served my friend and I was definitely unhappy to be there and extremely rude to all clients except the ones she knew (regulars I'm assuming). Kind of ruined the experience for me; I probably won't be back."
/user_details?userid=GkbaBeSGvt-UmIcefpEARA,Andrea L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"What a lovely, relaxed spot. Despite being only a few blocks from the Mont-Royal métro station, it is on a quiet corner. I can see myself coming here with my knitting whenever I need to get out of the house.I had a soy latté, which was decent but not memorable, and a yummy raspberry danish. I think I'd return more for the atmosphere than the espresso...but I will be back.Tip:  they will give you your drink (and food) in to-go packaging if you want to sit on the terrace. Next time I'll ask if they'll give me a real mug if I promise to bring it back inside when I'm done. I guess with one person working they can't bus tables outside.This is one of the cafés participating in the Indie Coffee Passport (2014)."
/user_details?userid=1hT5oewKWdp-RsZL4J0UfQ,Sarah D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Off the beaten path you'll find this charming little coffee spot. The coffee itself is great, I had a latte. Service was friendly especially for an Anglo such as myself in a more Français part of town. There were complimentary blankets in case you catch a chill from the cold Montreal air. Overall environment - I wasn't feeling the vibes for personal reasons, just didn't feel like my style, but if I'm in the area I'll gladly pop in."
/user_details?userid=Nv2iWFVFbhiRZdAOqS1iQA,Rose D.,"Raleigh, NC",5 star rating,"A review is, by its nature, a very personalized and biased thing.  I was torn about how many stars to give this place because I know what I value in a coffee shop isn't what most people value in a coffee shop, so that may skew the validity of my review to some people.  That being said, Le Moineau Masque is, hands down, my favorite coffee shop in any city.  I found it through the International Coffee Passport (if you live in mtl and don't know what it is, definitely look it up asap) and find myself continuing to come back here even though I could get a free coffee elsewhere.  Why?  Well, I know the coffee isn't  necessarily the BEST, but it's plenty delicious enough for me.  What sets this place apart from the rest is the service.  I've never, ever been to a coffee shop where I got such quirky and friendly service.  In fact, it's hard for me to recall a coffee shop where I didn't feel like I was burdening the baristas; it's become an accepted part of coffee-shop-culture, and I love that Le Moineau Masque doesn't stoop to that level.  To top it off, the space is pretty sweet, with a super nice outdoor terrasse, far enough removed from the bustle of Mont-Royal to give you a feeling of seclusion but close enough for easy access.  I'd much, much rather have a warm interaction and a not-wobbly chair than a *perfect* cup of coffee."
/user_details?userid=r0cPBif1O35oiOt8Eu1A3Q,Xin H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"What a wonderful little find in a quiet part of town.  My friend and I were looking for free wifi and a place for a snack and were lucky enough to be nearby this place when we revved up the Yelp machine.  Friendly staff, delicious panini, ice cream and tea (sorry, we didn't have any coffee).  Beautiful relaxing decor and nice outdoor patio."
/user_details?userid=po_RUcxdFMbAFyMhwc8D0w,Inverness G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is a true neighborhood cafe, which captures the Plateau spirit. The baristas are friendly, real, and full of personality, in the very best way. I love the exposed brick and light fixtures. It's really a lovely space. I always pick up a cold brew, and sometimes a pistachio croissant or a yogourt parfait."
