Everything was perfect minus the fried jalapenos it was just too thick and big and did not have any place in that burger but nonetheless this burger was perfect! Also the service was impeccable, the decor was really beautiful I did not expect this place to look this way. We also ordered some other items from the menu and I was very pleased! We tried the lobster tacos , fried rock shrimp! The rose sangria was beyond my expectations.. I'm definitely excited to be coming here and trying out new things!"

I've been to the Laval Table 51 location many times over the years so I knew more or less what to expect at this new franchise location. EVERYTHING in this resto is gorgeous and modern. Seating is comfy and the wait staff do a good job given how busy they were.For starters I went with their Fiji drink and unfortunately it was pretty bad, so I cut off my drank on about halfway into this cocktail. Can't remember why I hated it but basically... not for me.I went with their signature beef and it's as good as I remember it. Perfectly braised beef is an art form and every bite was ravished and enjoyed to its fullest. I had to pace myself as I could have EASILY been the first one at my table cleaning up my plate before the rest of them were halfway into their meals.For dessert I went with their fried oreos and OH-MAMA.... delicious!!! Only complaint would be I'd easily polish twice this portion. :)The braised beef and oreos will bring me back in the future for sure. The price-tag however is indeed getting a little ridiculous. This alone will prevent me from being a regular at T51, not because I can't afford it but it would be irresponsible to pay so much. You can easily pay over $60 for a single meal if you go for a drink, a main and a dessert. Rent in this area must be crazy."
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"*This review is a 3.5 *Brand new restaurant which opened recently replacing Portovino's. Extremely spacious, beautifully decorated and wonderful service by the friendly staff. The menu offers a wide variety of items such as salads, sandwiches, burgers, meats, seafood and pasta.I had their lentil soup which was mixed with green peas and string beans. It was the first time I had a lentil soup that was mixed with green beans and definitely not my cup of tea. I also had the shrimp burger which was too thick and had too much mayo. The burger also came with kale salad which was heavily dressed in a creamy sauce. I did enjoy the touch of parmesan cheese. For desert, I had the fried Oreo cookies with vanilla ice cream which was the best part of my meal. This is a great place to satisfy a large group as they have a variety of items on the menu to satisfy everyone. What was a bit disappointing was the lack of specialty or items which they are known for. I usually like to pick restaurants that have a specialty or a specific type of cuisine which I felt lacked here."

Their friendly staff, beautiful ambiance, great food and wine selection and bar to unwind while waiting for your table or just having a drink after a long day this is the place to be. Kudos for the great effort and personal touch. The reason I didn't give 5 Stars is the bad finishing of the sofa set where I was seated, it kept moving!"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here with my colleagues on a Thursday night. It was pretty busy and the parking was full. Luckily they have free valet parking!Some colleagues arrived 20 min before me and they only got water! The problem was the waiter hadn't taken their drink orders yet. I started with a Bloody Caesar of course. It was nothing special but it was good! We shared some starters namely the Kalamata olives and walnut hummus and guacamole, bacon and cheddar croquettes, popped rock shrimp and the beef carpaccio. The hummus and guacamole were delicious and good to share. It was served with homemade sesame crackers and potato chips. Since we were six people we ordered two servings of the croquettes so that we could eat have two. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and served with chipotle mayo. It was good but I didn't taste the bacon. If I hadn't read the menu I probably wouldn't know what kind of croquette I was eating.The popped rock shrimp was really good and served with sweet chilli sauce but I just dipped it in the chipotle mayo. The beef carpaccio had a layer of arugula on top as well as black garlic, cheese and truffle oil! Simply delicious! It was melting! Honestly the starters were awesome! I would go back and try other stuff.As a main I had the signature braised beef which came with vegetables like potato and carrots in a red wine sauce. The meat really does just like melt off the bone! The dish was a bit salty but I still enjoyed it. I paired it with a glass of dry red wine. I also tried my colleague's pork dish and the pasta dish and both were really good.The plates are a good size for the price! I was so full and brought half of my main home. For dessert we shared the deep fried Oreos which came with vanilla ice cream. The normal dish comes with five and we added one so that we could each have one. To be honest I've had better but at least it wasn't too sweet. I was sad that Portovino closed but now I'm happy that this place opened up instead. It's not a byob but the food here is really good! The only problem is that the service is very slow so if you are in a rush or very hungry I would wait and this place out another time."

The ambiance was very classy with a taste of warehouse, the staff were courteous, polite and very engaging. We liked the fact that the menu fit on one page so everything on it can be made to perfection all the time. My friend has a number of allergies but the kitchen was able make her salad one of a kind. The classic cheeseburger was on point and the Caesar salad great. All in all, a good first impression and we'll definitely be back!"
