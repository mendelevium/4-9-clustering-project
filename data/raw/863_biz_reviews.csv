I didn't know about the original location in old port so I'm glad they opened nearby so I could try! The staff is super friendly, my waitress repeated the specials for me at least 3 times because I didn't know what to choose (I can't thank her enough for her patience)! They have such good taco options. I eventually settled on the Lobster tempura tacos that come with aoili mayo and corn salsa. They were delicious. The lobster remained juicy yet didn't make the tempura soggy. I also got a small portion of guacamole and I thought it had a bit too much lime to be perfect but it was still very good. It was a bit pricey but I felt the quality made up for it. Just wouldn't visit on a weekly basis. The tacos of the moment are around $25-$30 for two and the guacamole was $6 for an entree size. I'll definitely be back to try other options though."
