/user_details?userid=8HgD0L1f0fpT3Dc5Ki_bjQ,Adrian C.,"Plattsburgh, NY",5 star rating,Great selection of crepes both savory and sweet! Be patient the food is made with love and prepared to order. I recommend the Nordique Crepe with smoked salmon. The chef is happy to make substitutions to accommodate your diet and taste.  We got the Nordique with goat cheese instead of the creme frais.
/user_details?userid=S_9xTmBOARaqVis0WqlhPw,Yen Q.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,""" Bring your own cutlery!! "" That's what I was told, not once, but twice when i suggested that they provide real cutlery for those who eat in. Apparently they've had other clientele make the same request often enough, that the management has framed the details of their biodegradable plastic forks and knives. The plastic isn't stopping the line-up of satisfied clients, but a responsive business knows, that if you hear the same request 3x or more, it's wise to consider rather than frame a justification of biodegradable plastics to hold up to customers' face and tell them to bring their own cutlery!! If you eat-in and agree that you'd prefer cutting into your delicious crepe with a real fork and knife - let them know!!!!"

/user_details?userid=xva4w2TD1YjAzjxw4qjdRQ,Amelia S.,"Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is really close to where I live and I really enjoy it. Every time I try something new, I'm quite pleased. I particularly like the Maele, which is more of a desert crepe. The guy that runs it is also really friendly and fun to talk to."
