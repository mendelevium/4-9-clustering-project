/user_details?userid=Km4vNAXzbb8zoukhKzRNBg,Susan D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,One of my favorite poke places. I love the 50% poke the best!! Worth going out of my way. The staff is really nice and I recommend highly.

Ordered their sushi platter for 2 (includes an entree + 35 pieces, a very good deal) and were pleasantly surprised! Service was very fast. Sushi rolls are fresh with just the right amount of rice. Miso soup was also very good. They do free delivery after 4pm if you live close by!! We'll definitely be ordering from this place in the future."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,My family got a huge plate to share and it wasn't too bad! It's new I think so we didn't really know what we were going to get.I thought the rolls were fresh and the plater was beautiful. The menu is big and they have a nice lunch menu. With specials and combos. We placed an order to be delivered at 7pm and they were there on time. You pay in advance.I would order again.
/user_details?userid=RxPndFw7sdSX4hWMbIJBGQ,Philippe G.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",3 star rating,Went there for lunch. They have lunch special which is a good thing. I took the chicken katsu but I should have taken sushi. The chicken was ok. It tasted like kitchen. The rolls that come with it were not that great. I was with someone who took the sushi. I will be honest and I regret not taking those. They looked fresh with the right amount of rice. I'll try those next time and update my review accordingly

/user_details?userid=CUC2wuc4d8a6U5yUg7l7lA,Yulu H.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,A good fast-food spot. Tried their pad Thai and chicken Katsu rice the other day they were good. Portions are big. Hope the pad Thai can have more stuff other than noodle and protein (normally pad Thai would have condiments like bean sprouts). Preparation for pokes looks quick but for hot entrees were a bit slow.

/user_details?userid=XFAKf6sLA4j58PntH0zqlg,Marcella S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The best sushi in Montreal so far! Me and the hubby found this place by chance. We had come to Mile End for a food event that happened to have long lines and was too crowded. Great surprise! This tiny place holds great, fresh food at an affordable price (we had a huge amount of sushi and a Miso soup). The special attention to our satisfaction was noticed since minute 1 and ended with an offer of spring rolls on the house. That's the old (and effective) way to gain customers! Will come back any time!"

/user_details?userid=hxskTrTTgZh_Imyn4EOnCw,Pat M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,Great little family run sushi place in central Montreal. Guys who work there are really nice. Fluent in both English and French. Prices seemed pretty cheap and food was very fresh. Give it a shot.
