/user_details?userid=HgAMf4NZtURINEf6PZs4XQ,Cherry L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Great place for an intimate dinner with friends or a date. The Moroccan themed setting was unique and had a warm ambience. My boyfriend and I both ordered Couscous, $19 each. The Merguez, which are Tunisian lamb sausages, was juicy and spiced well. The Chicken was average, slightly dry. The meats are served on a bed of saucy and tasty couscous and assorted vegetables. The Baklava, $4, was light and crispy and finished the meal off nicely.Tad pricy for what it is but a great option to try something new amidst the abundance of pub food in the area."

I've never had such a tagine in my life before! This sucked! It tasted too salty. And very little meat!!! I was expected at least a good chunk of meat but nothing more than a few very small pieces of meat! The worst tagine I ever had in my life I'd say.The delivery was slow btw. I was expecting that with an extreme empty stomach, the food would have tasted even better than it was but this didn't happen!"

Unfortunately we didn't know this place had BYOW and doesn't serve any alcohol so we missed out. The restaurant is nicely decorated and feels cozy but the space is very tight. Service was rude. We were a party of 5 and as this was our first time trying North African cuisine. We asked our waiter for popular options and she just pointed to the entire section of the menu. Ummmm I can read myself. We got an assortment of appetizers but nothing stood out. For my main I ended up getting the grilled kebab couscous. It was a huge portion but tasted like steamed vegetables. When the bill came, it was in French so we took a while to read through it but our waitress barged in claiming she didn't overcharge us. Not a fun experience and I most definitely won't revisit or recommend. Service: 1/5Presentation: 4/5Taste: 2/5Price: 2/5 Ambiance: 3/5Overall: 2/5"
/user_details?userid=DsFwvVBgQkfH4_yfzLa0Jw,Mykela M.,"Queens, Queens, NY",3 star rating,"This has to be somewhere between a 3.5 and 3.9. I really wanted to give this 5 stars but there were a few things that really threw me off. First off it took forever to be served! They requested we arrive 30 minutes before the belly dancing show, which we did. In that time we ordered our food, waiting for the show. We got there at 8:30 but didn't get served and entertained until 10:30/10:45! The food came out around 9:50 and while it was amazing we were starving by then and getting more and more tired. Finally the dancer came out, and she was lovely. The space was a bit small but she made it work well. She did two performances so this sort of compensated for the long wait. They also only have one restroom, which is usually fine but with the dancer getting ready for her acts and patrons attempting to use the restroom it made it very congested. While they informed us the dancer was running late it would have been nice if they had offered free refreshments instead of starving us between courses. The menu is VERY small, two options for each course. Both options were really amazing so no complaints but be sure you really like the menu otherwise you'll be screwed. I would say their food was the best part, the performance was nice but the service needs some serious help!"

Both times, the wait for the food was painfully and unacceptably long. It was about 40 minutes for our food to arrive! The price was a bit high but reasonable for the portion. The service is slow, very rude and not welcoming both times we were there. They were less rude when we ordered Table d'Hote (about 40$), instead of A la Carte (25$)."
/user_details?userid=Sq0KIXE9cg2-JG0Yo4iA5w,Daniel W.,"Winter Park, FL",5 star rating,"I invited my family for dinner here. We ordered a variety of couscous, tajines and grilled plates and all was excellent. We ordered the chicken skewers, the kefta skewers, the lamb Tajine, the chicken Tajine and the couscous lamb. Very warm ambiance and staff is very professional and friendly. They took care of our group and service was always attentive."
/user_details?userid=yRB4UrgnLs3BxbVM1QQ0Gw,Sababa S.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"This is the first time I tried Moroccan cuisine so I'm not a good judge for the food. I had the lamb tajine. It is served in a large portion and with couscous on the side. I liked the warm couscous, with chickpeas topping. The lamb dish was cooked with exotic choice of ingredients like prunes and apricots. I liked it until it got a bit boring after some time and I couldn't finish the dish. It's also a bring your own wine restaurant, so it's very convenient."

The lamb melts in your mouth, the mix of salt n sweet is a delight to any palet the couscous was well made. The staff was attentive, the service was on a good pace not rushed. The staff made sure we had enough water or tea n offered refills. Highly recommend best couscous n tajine."
/user_details?userid=jjuZIuNaooLS3CYyO75PGg,Anna K.,"Northfield, MN",4 star rating,"Delicious, and helpful waitstaff. Though its a modest space, it wasn't too full or loud - but not at all deserted. The coucous was fantastic. We ordered the mousakka (not the same as the Greek version, sweeter and served with olive bread) and the the Royal Couscous platter with merguez (beef and lamb sausage, strongly flavored), lamb shanks, chicken and veggies. For two, this was very generously portioned and delicious. The veggies and chicken were surprisingly my favorites, despite my deep love of lamb.At around 2000 there was a floor show of belly dancing which went on a little longer than was really necessary,  but stylistically,  the performer was one of the better belly dancers I had ever seen, and some of the floor staff joined her in a very fun group dance.Overall, this was a wonderful find from a MTL blog article on the best morrocan restaurants in the city. Highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=Uaqawx2iD0mT5YP_akJrJw,Heli N.,"Pickering, Canada",4 star rating,"Spent a birthday weekend in Montreal and decided to try out this little Moroccan restaurant for dinner on Saturday night. It was around 6:30 when we sat down to eat so the place wasn't quite packed but it steadily got busier. We were seated directly by the open window was great for catching a breeze, but a little tricky if you're dining with a very fidgety one-year old. As a side note, if you're planning to bring an infant or smaller toddler, they didn't have a highchair, so be warned. We were kindly offered a booster seat, but there was no way to strap it into the actual chair so I spent more time trying to keep my daughter from toppling off. We managed to get through the meal without incident, although it was a little awkward because there were some folks sitting outside on the benches just directly staring at us the entire time.We ordered the moussaka to start, and then continued on with entrées of the couscous Royal and merguez tagine. The moussaka wasn't exactly as I pictured (I guess I was thinking more of Greek moussaka I'd had before? ) but this was actually a dip of blended tomatoes, eggplant and peppers topped with raisins and served with four small buns. It was tasty but I found it a bit too sweet for a savoury dip because the raisins sort of took over and masked the other flavours. The bread was warm and soft and it was a good size for two people to share. The mains were where this place really shined. The couscous royal was jam-packed: juicy lamb, a good sized chunk of chicken breast and a merguez sausage combined with super soft strips of zucchini, carrot, sweet potatoes and chickpeas all on a bed of couscous. My only real complaint would be that the chicken was a bit on the dry side, and that the merguez wasn't grilled, so the texture was a little unappetizing even though the flavour was still good. Would definitely return here when I go and visit MTL in the future."

/user_details?userid=GjfXgTtoTAzJ4ZBOuT7IHw,Wendy K.,"Mountain View, CA",5 star rating,"We were a group of 8 on last Saturday night for the belly dance show dinner. Our seating was on the groups corner where there are comfy couches all around and nice cushions. The decor is matching the restaurant them and gives its warmth. We had the 4 course set menu dinner for the belly dance evening show. We had the choice between the traditional soup (Chorba) and the chef salad. Both were very good as we tried from each other's. I took the lamb couscous, the meat was so tender it falls off the bones and melts in your mouth. My friends took the tajines lamb and tajine chicken, and couscous merguez, all was delicious and served in big portions. We ended up the meal with refreshing green mint tea and sumptuous Baklawa dessert. The belly dance show was entertaining and the belly dancer herself was friendly and approaching the crowd to dance and have fun. It was an exquisite experience for us. We loved the food, ambiance, service and music."
/user_details?userid=3sxUzBrvXBUCZq-XllJraA,Gene S.,"Campbell, MO",5 star rating,"In our visit to Montreal we had the chance to try this Mediterranean restaurant. The mainly offer couscous and tajines. I took the couscous royal with a lamb shank, a chicken stripe and oriental sausage. My wife took the chicken tajine with lemon and green olive. We loved our experience there with amazing flavors from the Mediterranean region The sauce and broth they have for the couscous is so special and rich with flavors and spices. Our waitress was very friendly and answered all our detailed questions about the plates with attention and passion. She also gave us recommendations and appetizers suggestion.We ended our meal by sharing their home-made dessert omali. Very rich dessert with coconuts, milk and raisin. It was a very good choice.I told my friends back home about this restaurant for their visit next week. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are visiting Montrea"

I got slightly disappointed by their food. It wasn't that great but at least I got to try tajine. However, I liked the ambience. We actually had a great time there. We chose their group menu, so got to try a lot of their dishes. You can bring your own wine or if you don't drink alcohol, then you can bring sparkling juice like I did lolYou can read my full review along with pictures on my blog: arzanrestos.blogspot.ca/…"
/user_details?userid=uFx2Q3-3hMc4iiTMMJ25wg,Tony C.,"Miami, FL",5 star rating,"Excellent food, especially the lamb tajine. It is served in the tajine plate and cooked in the oven in it. They give you a bowl of couscous with sauce, chickpeas and raisin on the side. Very tasty. Their baklava and green mint tea are the best to seal your meal and treat your palate. Nice selection of music in a warm ambiance lit with candles and colorful chandeliers. Our evening was complemented with excellent service, with a professional waiter and very friendly."

/user_details?userid=rJqmB3F93EwLxUSKFLGg1w,Tatiana R.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"This place is TERRIBLE. You probably won't be sick or anything, but the price they ask for the quality they give is ridiculous. Chicken pastilla was a tasteless aggregate of overcooked bird, stuck in a dry sock, with a cinamon challenge on top as the only spice. The full luxury experience couscous for 30 dol was supposedly a combo, but came in a single serving, complete joke, two sad strips of chicken, a sad dried apricot and way too many nuts. Couscous is supposed to feel like a generous and succulent dish and this was depression in a foil container. The soup was a warm lemon juice with nuts and tomato. Not bad. Not worth it. If this was cheap, I wouldn't have said anything. But a rip off at a less than average quality is not tolerable. Go to K Moon or Les deux oliviers. Much better."
/user_details?userid=bGbr0SVYXTO6eHfnqoT0Hw,Rebecca S.,"Memphis, TN",5 star rating,"Yummy! My husband and I split the Couscous Royal with lamb, chicken, and Moroccan sausage, and it was delicious! It was also enormous, so we had lots of leftovers to take home. The Moroccan mint tea was delicious, and they let you add your own sugar. I don't like my tea as sweet as Moroccans drink it, so that was great! We went on a Sunday night, and the atmosphere was subdued and quiet. There was limited staff and just a few other couples there. Cozy atmosphere, beautiful decorations, and an eclectic mix of music."

/user_details?userid=ptFIlnOVFCPBOStUUXnkmA,Rua A.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"This is the first time for me... I used to eat veggie couscous in Restaurant Kamela which I very like. I've ordered from Mint and Couscous because it's the only rest that foodora deliver to my address and I said I'll give it a chance. The result, I don't like the veggie couscous that they have... some vegetables not well cooked and I feel it's not tasty at all. I regret ordering from them."
/user_details?userid=s5f8y4osCEemGHnR5RHzgw,Eduardo A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have a five star average. Rarely can we find places that offers A refreshingly original culinary Avenue for those, who just as me, are tired of always eating the same old traditional Italian/Asian/western food. I had the best Lamb tagine that I ever had in Montreal. The meat was so moist that I literally felt it was melting in my mouth. I think it's also really great that the meet is all halal as this is the only type of meat that I eat."
/user_details?userid=5G1LLdZNxwswR1TjMfiMig,Iatemontreal Q.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Trying new foods is always an adventure, but eating at Menthe et Couscous is more than an adventure for your pallet it is a delight for your senses. Situated near the Quartier des Spectacles, hiding on Emery street, Menthe et Couscous is a delightful way to spend an evening.Although a small establishment, with seating for around 40, the restaurant welcomes you with warm colours and an inviting atmosphere. Comfortable pillows line the banquette encouraging guests to relax and sup on the suburb cuisine. On Saturday evenings, you will be entertained by the divine belly dancing display. We highly recommend attending but make sure you have reservations so you will not be disappointed.Although Menthe et Couscous is only open for evening dining, you can contact the restaurant for a special lunch time menu. This option is available only on demand and for groups of six or more.Should you crave a glass of wine or beer to accompany your meal, you are invited to bring your own and the staff would be happy to assist you in opening it.Hosted by the owners Riham and Mansour, we were treated to an amazing meal of Tunisian and Egyptian dishes. We started with the Chorba. This was a refreshing soup that warmed the body and the soul. Freshly made and piping hot it was a excellent start to our dining experience.For the main course we opted for the lamb, it came highly recommended by the chef. It certainly did not disappoint. The lamb was tender and cooked to perfection. Served with the most tender and flavorful vegetables we have tasted in a longtime all served on top of a large serving of couscous.The meal was both hardy and healthy, cooked without oil, all meals are freshly made. All the main ingredients are purchased daily.For our dessert, we were presented with a wonderful baklava. Not too sweet it was the perfect ending to an exquisite meal.We highly recommend you try Menthe et Couscous next time you are in the area taking in a show, or go on Saturday evening and enjoy a show with your meal.iatemontreal.com"

The service was TERRIBLE and the food was far from the best...the cost was NOT worth the demeaning experience!!! We came in the restaurant and it was half empty with all guest sitting at the center of the restaurant. First, it took a while for the hostess to greet us and then when she finally did, she asked us to go sit at a table in a cold are by the door. There were so many free tables at the center around the few guests they had so I told her that we preferred to sit at one of the tables at the center but she insisted that we should sit by the door. After moments of back and forth she let us sit with the other guests. She was also the waitress and barely gave us any consideration and was very cold; this was my most uncomfortable restaurant experience anywhere in the world. If you want to eat North African or Middle Eastern food in Montreal, do yourself a favor and find another place!"
