/user_details?userid=v0EpMF9gSH31Brr3PXpVcg,Puja L.,"Rockville, MD",5 star rating,"We spotted this place from the window of the taxi on the way to our hotel. The name caught our eye because it sounded a bit silly, and we just kind of laughed at it. A couple days later, we were exhausted from walking several kilometers roaming around Montreal and couldn't muster the energy to go out in search of dinner. Once we saw they do Uber Eats deliveries - we figured we might as well give it a shot! The food did take a while to arrive, but it was worth the wait! The food was properly spicy and quite good. We got the nihari, which in a lot of restaurant is super oily - this was just as rich without that greasiness. The naan is only ok, but the nihari was really enjoyable. Biryani is, of course, good as well. The meal totally hit the spot!"

Some items run out early in the day, so call them in advance to make sure you will get what you want!"

/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"I am constantly being surprised by this place. I never really have time to sit down and eat something when I pass by so I never thought about going but recently I had a real craving for indian food so I thought why not. They're open till 11pm most days which I didn't even know. I had the samosa chaat, and the butter chicken thali so far. Both were delicious and filling. I will say the butter chicken wasn't the best even though it did hit the spot. I much prefer their samosas, chickpea mix, and lentil mix. Their naan bread is also just ok.For the price though, you can't beat it. Service is also incredibly fast and friendly. They accept debit now which helps a lot since I never carry cash."
/user_details?userid=TJAZ4h-YNSk9vqdEmuwaIg,Roxane V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It was 11:15pm on Thursday and we ordered a lamb biryani large as they were out of the chicken biryani. We specifically asked the to make it spicy like twice when we placed the order in the phone for a take out. We got home and were surprised as the biryani was so mild. Didn't enjoy it at all. On the bright side though, if u dont mind eating non spicy then ur gonna love it cuz the rice does have the flavor of the lamb which means it was cooked in it. And they also gave a lamb shank and a few more lamb cubes. For us, it lacked the fire big-time so not gonna order again from here for sure also because we know our birynais and this wasn't one of them!"
/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I was craving authentic Pakistani cuisine (for those who are unaware, there is quite a difference between Indian/Pakistani flavours) and a friend recommended Student Tasty Biryani as it a family-run business.We got there after 9pm and it was quite full inside, with people coming and going- the place is nothing special, it is a small basement joint with a few meal options shown as pictures on the walls and a different 'Special of the Day' which is usually around 10$. They serve on plates and seating is very basic.Despite originally wanting to order the Biryani special (which included beef or chicken chapli kababs), we opted for the Nihari. It took a while for the Nihari to come but when it did, it was piping hot with extremely tender meat, served with naan and rice. My husband was a little disappointed as usually, Nihari is eaten with naan and not rice - they had given more rice than naan and the naan was basic, store-bought. The Nihari however, was absolutely delicious and on par with the authentic taste that I have had in the past. We also tried the STB chicken roll - spicy tandoori chicken in a butter-chicken type sauce wrapped in a fresh paratha... super cheap and super tasty! Highly recommend, even if you are just passing-by and not too hungry, grab one of these and you will be hooked! It is 3 / 4$ I believe.The brother of the owner (who served us) was extremely friendly and passionate about the food & place. He told us the lovely story behind its opening and that there is a second branch opening soon! Delicious authentic Pakistani cuisine, huuuuge portions & decent prices. Will definitely be back (with a bigger appetite) to enjoy the mouth-watering famous Biryani!"
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Recently, I ordered through UberEats from this place. Don't know much about their service, but the food was exceptional. I ordered chana chat (crushed samosa, cooked chickpeas, tomatoes, onions, coriander, spices, tamarind sauce, mint sauces and plain yogurt). It was so good, that all the flavors were well blended and it was giving a great satisfaction. Of course, they are known for their Biryani. In my normal days, I barely eat biriyani but I needed to check this out. I believe in my belly and in my mouth that this is the best Biryani I ever had. I took the mixed vegetables one. What made it special is, crispy onions and coriander on top of the dish. From the aroma to the taste, is was heavenly. Definitely recommended!"

/user_details?userid=LC1-h542s1k1OxNs7QzwNA,M Akter T.,"Cornwall, Canada",5 star rating,"We went there 2 times thus far. Had a chicken biriyani and a nihari. Both were good and tasty. The spices were just right and I will definitely go there again. The portions are enough for two. The nihari was so much that 2 of us were easily full. The biriyani has 2 sizes, small one is little more than enough for 1 but the large one easily fills up 2."
/user_details?userid=1TpPrIGwpUVzjaGjCX4sXw,Mimi K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It's good biryani and affordable prices - a great deal for students or those who are inna budget. Unfortunately, they do not accept debit or credit cards which is really inconvenient sometimes. The ambiance inside the restaurant is not lively, and very boring. I would recommend for take-out."
/user_details?userid=CFB9glegliFCT7dJxdLNsA,Jawad K.,"Saint-Hubert, Canada",4 star rating,"Lovely story behind the opening of this indian ""cafeteria"".. I will spare you the details but just ask the owner or his brothers why is there a Master engineering degree on the wall behind the cash...We had been wanting to go eat there for quiet a long time and we finally did and do not regret it .. I got carried away and did not even order a biryani but will return for it because when i saw the portions i fell of my chair ' they are hugeThis time around I ordered a Nihari which came with rice and naan .. Personally nihari is not something i usually eat with rice at all give me 3 naan but not a bowl a rice lol !We also ordered chicken rolls, they were lovely its bbqd chicken very moist juicy and well seasoned:)I will go back to try out their speciality : biryani"
/user_details?userid=IdvZAAonvV-PnEyfwhlZFA,Sameer S.,"Lilburn, GA",2 star rating,This place is has its moment. Its a unique food joint mainly for college kids. Its super busy with to go orders and foot traffic during the weekend. Only order Biryani nothing else. All other items on the are heated up in the microwave. You can literally hear the microwave going hard at work.
/user_details?userid=jMHlwDq5b2zqhV5TyyFKPA,Yojna J.,"Victoria, Canada",5 star rating,"As I was craving for spicy Indian food, I decided to give it a shot. I arrived there and when I got in, there were a line up of people waiting for their foods and then I placed my order. As it was my first time here I wanted to try their biryani and I saw just regular plate is $6.99 + tax and i also ordered a samosa. My food arrived within 10 minutes and it was piping hot full with chicken and flavours and rice. I was already so happy and when I had the first bite of the chicken biryani, I was delighted as it was so delicious and hot! The portions were huge and definitely more than enough for one, you can also share it with 2 people. I was so full and happy that I came here to try it!!!They also had other food on their menus such as thaali and other Indian dishes. The decor of this place is quite tacky but who cares? You're going for the food and to fill you up. The pakistanais biryanis were so good and I also paid attention to the other customers' food and saw how they serve a lot for the little price they charge. I'd come back for sure :)"
/user_details?userid=c6LWafb5zWs0dbH8AJ5g2A,Farhan H.,"River North, Chicago, IL",5 star rating,Ordered chicken tikka Biryani using Uber eats. Biryani came to n packed very nicely along with raita and a bottle of water. Â It was done just perfectly and tasted amazing. We highly recommend this place.
/user_details?userid=fK4TwuMf05s2VNt56cfg2w,Ramsh K.,"Middletown, CT",2 star rating,I found plastic in my food and they charge for everything they can. It's good biryani but the plastic really threw me off. They do have vegetarian biryanis
/user_details?userid=WHHb1DaWROpiVQUB1JuX0Q,Ne M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,This no-nonsense place makes excellent biryani. They also make a delicious beef nihari. It's legitimately good Pakistani/Indian food for good prices and no fuss.I like.

Great for your budget, and very helpful staff. My family and I brought a big order for 8 people here, and everyone went home happy. If I were from Montreal, I'd sure be eating here again and again."
/user_details?userid=1V7883W5i_F3mptabTXFIw,Sarah S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Best Biryani in town? Perhaps. I have tried Sana, Thali and the likes and so far, Student Tasty wins my heart. Take it from a true Desi person, the mark of my iddentity is a good ol' biryani meal. Love their Chicken Biryani; just $8 but full of flavor. It's not like the one you get home but it's as good as it gets in Montreal. My sister and I order from here often during our homesick stay-in nights. I've never visited the shop, mostly called for home delivery so no idea about ambience. But as for the Biryani, Ma'Sha Allah!"
/user_details?userid=UCk_jxZBuzEVEXtHp8Fu7w,Aron E.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Love the place in general, good quantity of food for the price. The service is slow though most of the time food is worth waiting for. Lots of rules and directions throughout the place. Only accepts cash or debit and sometimes charges extra for using debit card."
/user_details?userid=VsIPc8MaaM1N36trlRWBdg,Bunny L.,"Saint-JÃ©rÃ´me, Canada",4 star rating,Ordered 2 large Chicken Biryani for about $22 and it was delicious even though there was an excess amount of oil swimming in the rice. The thing that was displeasing was the sound of a microwave going on for about 2-3 times in the kitchen. Let's just hope that they're not microwaving our lunch.
/user_details?userid=w-gL6px0iCRb8lJcEFXzlA,Tamim S.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Average Biriyani at an average price. They only accept cash or interac, Â sketchy in that aspect. Customer service is generally prompt and friendly."
/user_details?userid=yRB4UrgnLs3BxbVM1QQ0Gw,Sababa S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,I frequently order in from this place. I love their chicken biryani. Very affordable as well.
/user_details?userid=dNIxs3_qcAuF8S9kS9iFCQ,Rafaella A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This place is accurately named. It is the best place to go when you are a student and on a budget and want to eat a real portion of food. If you get the Special (which is from noon to 3pm if I remember correctly) it will be enough food to feed you for lunch, I got full before finishing the entire container. It is really cheap, I forget if it was like $5 or $6, but it is definitely your money's worth. I went and also ordered Ã  la carte, just to try it out, the butter chicken and rice with a beverage, it was $7.99. They also have a good deal for two mango lassis, I think one goes for $2.99 and two for $3.99, but if you feel adventurous, they also have a variety of bottled drinks: Lychee and Basil seeds or Mango and Basil seeds, those looked amazing and I didn't get to try them yet. Definitely will on my next visit!"
/user_details?userid=AStTppA8-jqhDxF2kajwaw,Rajendra RÃ©jean K. C. B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,This place is open late which is probably a very good business decision. The people here were quite nice. They took our order a few minutes after closing time. I had a flavourful mango lassi that was a tad bit on the watery side but pleasant nevertheless. Alison had the vegetarian biriyani which she said was good. The chana masala was good but the naan was subpar and reminded me of terrible supermarket naan. This place should be a tad cheaper if you take the quality into consideration. All in all I would go elsewhere under the most optimal circumstances but if I happened to be around central Concordia late at night and Al-Baghdadi was again closed for some reason I probably would go once more. Try Thali a few blocks on Saint-Marc which is much better and might even be a better price.

/user_details?userid=iXDBMxW75KIJI2K9r6zAZQ,Linda T.,"Seal Beach, CA",2 star rating,"The food is very tasty and generously portioned. However, it's not a good value for the cost without a student discount. We had to go up and ask for the beverages that came with the combos we ordered-the clerks didn't seem very interested in customer service. The interior dining area was smoke-filled, which must have been from someone smoking in the kitchen. My biggest turn-off, though, was a sign saying their tap water is not potable, so if you want water it's $0.70 for a cup of bottled water. What kind of restaurant doesn't have potable tap water?!"

Something is wrong...Place could do with better ambiance, I know it's a cheap food, but fresh tiles and better lighting go a long way No music?! Common y'all put on some Qawwali or Coke Studio on youtube on low volume... Show off that Pakistani musiqi...Add napkins on the tables"
/user_details?userid=7EDlw6THZ5viaF-P6Y_CEA,Bhavin G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Our first time there, we ordered chicken biryani ""up-sized"" , wow that was really a big plate of biryani. They have various other options to choose from, but I have never tried anything else other than chicken biryani. Biryani tastes Â good. Quite a few times we had chicken biryani to go, I must say they have maintained the consistency with the taste. Worth trying it if you are a biryani fan."
/user_details?userid=FaXXrC_dAr-sFCD8KT_wRg,Alexandre F.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"As much as I would love to never write a negative review because I think most people who write them are sad people with nothing else to do but complain, my love for good Indian food obligates me as a citizen of the world to spread the word.I would like to start on a positive note, the staff was very friendly. But that's about it for the good part.I ordered their specialty, the chicken biryani with the works. Throughout my meal I had to dodge chicken bones and raw peppercorns that were scattered in the rice, which was, in my opinion, not very flavorful and poorly seasoned. In total I counted 7 chicken bones and 9 peppercorns, averaging one of the two every 2-3 bites.I sincerely advise you to stay away from this place and apologize for adding negative energy on the Internet, which doesn't need more than it already has."
/user_details?userid=LD0JKpsZQYjJzafeZu_9mw,Nadia C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I am always on the hunt for authentic chicken biryani, and Student Tasty Biryani has put an end to the search. Spicy chicken that melts off the bone, fluffy basmati rice with the perfect blend of yellow, orange and white grains, a hint of cilantro. This is a small, no-frills establishment, with a very chicken-themed menu. Chicken biryani, chicken korma, chicken karahi, butter chicken, chicken tikka, chicken tikka biryani. Daal chawal is the veg option, & aloo matar keema if you like red meat. I have only had the biryani so far, but am going to eat my way through the menu and report back. The chef and staff are incredibly friendly. And a small army of delivery boys will bring this deliciousness right to your door."

Portions are huge and affordable (although prices have gone up since they first opened). I've only ever gotten it delivered and it can sometimes be iffy, but it's always worth it.
