I am still amazed that their food stays as good as the music they play at this joint. Pure Soul, Funk, R&B with a lot of Motown into the equation. Kudos to your playlist or DJ.Breakfasts here are simple and yummy, and surpsingly, with just one waitress they get everything done in time. The fruit they offer here is fresh as it gets. I had an orange juice which was wildly good."

Old decor with nice sunny dining area Food is pretty good. Feves ah lard were exceptional $45 for a breakfast plate and a drink each so I am happyThe service was very good!So, you should try this restaurants established in 1983!"
/user_details?userid=ylvZ6HZnKYjhZoGb8gEY3Q,Kameryn R.,"Highland, NY",5 star rating,"A great spot to go to when you're in need of a classic meal. We got burgers (the classic and the sombrero) and both were more than filled, just from the main course. With your burger you also get a large helping of poutine fries and a small salad/coleslaw. To finish off our meal we got a slice of chocolate cake which our waiter kindly warmed up for us. We're on our honeymoon and have time to waste, but this may not be the right place to go if you're in a rush. The staff treats you like family and wants their guests to stay a while and enjoy themselves, so they take their time. Overall we had a great experience and would come back!"
/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Number one breakfast/ brunch spot in the Plateau, I promise you. It's my new haunt for Sundays out. Their breakfast cook knows WHAT. is. going. on. with that brekkies menu!!! I could have knelt before her and pledged lifelong allegiance after finishing my goat cheese and sun dried tomato omelette. Plus, I got to eat some of my boyfriend's breakfast, too, and I couldn't decide whose was better - his was a crepe stuffed with bacon, emmental cheese, mushrooms, etc and drizzled with maple syrup. Heaven never tasted so good! Also, you have your choice of classic diner coffee from a drip machine, OR espresso-based coffees to top up your FABULOUS breakfast. The décor is a riot - total 50s diner feel, with a quirky twist - I sat next to a giant, wooden, carved... vulture? That jukebox is a beautiful relic. Total comfortable layout to the seating, so that no matter where you're sitting, you feel like you have your own space. The interior doesn't stop at the booths up front, either - keep on heading towards the back to discover the stage seating, along with another smaller, lower section that leads to the hidden outdoor patio. There's plenty of seating here for everyone, despite how it looks when you walk in the front door. The noise level is moderate and reasonable, too - you can have a conversation without having to raise your voice, despite how packed they seem to typically be.Impeccable staff - we were treated like gold. Now, I haven't yet tried the burgers, but they looked amazing and that's what I'll go back for next. Or maybe, I'll go back for another to-die-for breakfast and stay an extra hour till I'm hungry again, and then get a burger."
/user_details?userid=BrUO40cgrDZBDMt1DMN9jw,Raigan A.,"Conway, SC",1 star rating,"Horrible experience. We waited 40 minutes for two burgers that were both supposed to be served with a salad and fries. Finally when we received our order, the food was cold and one of the salads was completely missing. To be fair we probably wouldn't have eaten it anyway- we were horrified by the other salad that we did receive (a few pieces of soggy lettuce, a piece of tomato, and a few carrot sticks just slapped together.) Disturbing. The server was rude and un-empathetic and there wasn't even a lunch rush to explain this behavior. There was only one other couple besides us waiting for their food. Do not recommend and will not be coming back anytime soon!!"
/user_details?userid=09VZR24MfJIL9q8NNSG9Yg,Bruno L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is a must. Avoid line ups for La Banquise or Ma poule mouillée. Just walk a few blocks West on Rachel Street and you will be able to enjoy Quebec's special meal, la poutine and a large selection of traditional delicious burgers that taste like home-made ones. This is an institution in Montreal since its opening 35 years ago. Friendly staff too. There is also a nice terrace at the back."
/user_details?userid=bcalCCwEIM3FVhx7amRawQ,Nesrine O.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Dinner spot in the Plateau. I went there to try their brunch but was not offered during the week only in the week end. It's sad because it will be a great idea to propose breakfast everyday and we were not the only one in the restaurant interested by that. They proposed omelets but that's not my favorite option. So i'll probably come back. During the week they propose a comfort food menu, with several choices of poutine, salads, sandwiches and burger. I took the Club sandwich, a huge portion, really well done and well presented with the salad. The service was nice, warm and efficient. I loved the place so cute, I might changed my rating after trying the brunch .... :)"
/user_details?userid=yDBHKkWEld05vL4LiAazRg,Phoebe C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Cute diner with an interesting take on old classics. Paul got a ""chicken pesto burger"" and I got the ""tofu club sandwich"". I was super excited to see that they had many more-than-vegetarian-friendly options, meals actually designed around tofu instead of just excluding the meat!I ordered coffee and Paul got the house made peach iced tea, which was delicious. The coffee was decent but I had to ask for a refill despite being one of two tables there.When the food came we were stunned by the amount on the plate. Many fries! Much sandwich! The club came stacked high (or long, I guess) with well-buttered toast, sauteed mushrooms, thick tofu, mayo, and tomato. It was delicious and rich and hard to eat without loosing most of the mushrooms. Worth the challenge. The chicken burger is what Paul describes as ""unexpected, not exactly what I wanted, but good"". There was little pesto, but rather a very chicken-y flavour. The bun was crisp, but not too crisp, and the other toppings were great. The mountain of fries were thin cut, extra deep fried, and amazing. The salad ok, cute and colourful but too vinegary, especially with the pickled onions.All and all, great and unique food at a fair price, would return."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I think I should mention that I don't eat burgers often so I'm no expert when it comes to buns or beef patties. That being said, I sure did love my burger at L'Anecdote, it was a perfect mix of spices in meat patty and it sure looked tasty,  definitely a nice looking burger. I like the whole idea seating in the booth with a friend or your date, enjoying a sophisticated mix of ingredients in such a simple dish. My burger had blue cheese, mushrooms with a perfectly combined lamb patty. Definitely worth a try!"

/user_details?userid=0TJ01iwzVLXtr_EYcfqoWQ,Offer R.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Canada",3 star rating,"Lukewarm. I really wanted to like this place and took my family here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. The place was quite with soft music playing in the background and the retro vibe was really cool.  The waitress came by to get the orders and to serve them,  but somewhere along the way she disappeared and my girlfriend had to get up to find her for extra maple syrup (the serving with the French toast is very small). The portions aren't huge, but that's a healthy thing! Only the temperature of the eggs and the French toast was lukewarm at best, which is too bad. My Capuchino was good. No one came by to offer any refill for those who got filter coffee, no water were served and eventually we had to ask for it after we were done. Overall a solid 3 stars, nothing extreme. I may be back to try the burger, but probably not for breakfast."
/user_details?userid=wvfsPqJ2AJRL3sx-QZyCmQ,Franky F.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Unfortunately, long and pitiful service... The excuse is we are under staffed, but the presentation was mediocre, overcooked, unsavory... The busboy had the most empathy compared to a cold unsympathetic manger and careless cook. We waited 45min for our meal and 20min to be able to pay...it was an overall disappointment for a simple meal of burger & fries which I left half uneaten. Not to be repeated ever. Time in 19h50 - time out 21h15."
/user_details?userid=dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,Amanda C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A hidden gem! I had often spied l'Anecdote while biking along the Rachel bike path but never thought much more about. Then someone who lives nearby mentioned going there for breakfast most weekends, and an acquaintance mentioned having a great burger there. So when my partner and I found ourselves less than a block away, famished, it was time we tried it out. Are we ever glad we did!.When you first enter the restaurant it appears tiny. It isn't huge, but there is a back area that provides more seating. Everything is retro cool, right down to the jukebox. The staff are pleasant. Its a comfy place.The food!  We each ordered a burger, and neither of us ordered the standard beef!  I had the pesto chicken burger, and I was pleasantly surprised it wasn't a standard chicken breast, or even worse a generic chicken patty, but instead a yummy patty made of ground chicken, perfectly seasoned!  The burgers do not automatically come with sides, so we shared a poutine.  The standard size was perfect for sharing.  The gravy was delicious, so much so that I look forward to going back and trying a hot chicken sandwich or hamburger steak."
/user_details?userid=zsZVg16yjZu5NIiS0ayjrQ,Mary D.,"Etobicoke, Canada",4 star rating,"Tasty burgers and fries.  Loved mine with a root beer.   They were accomodating to our baby, and provided a highchair. Decor is very retro-diner and a bit tired.... Having read reviews, I thought it was going to be diner decor but in a stylish way... but it's actually just diner decor in a leftover way.  But the food is good, and the crowd seemed to be steady, so it's still something good!"
/user_details?userid=ILe3tzgnbGSaZfpArtJdjA,Mike S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Now this was a pleasant surprise. I must have walked passed this place 1000 times and never really got what it was. They changed their sign, stated what they do, and I went in. Very pleased with this discovery. I liked the food. I liked the service. I loved the retro diner look. i LIKE it!"

/user_details?userid=CPakwjSryrBF0niTLLPMOg,Beth W.,"Auteuil, Paris, France",5 star rating,"L'Anecdote is an adorable little diner that has so much going for it. Park yourself on one of the red seats in the old school diner booths and soak in the atmosphere. The counter in the back, the glass bottles of Coke and ketchup like in the old days, the vintage portraits up on the wall... the decor will rock you gently back to a softer and more innocent time. The menu offers classic diner food: burgers, fries, bagels, pancakes - it's all there. The only thing missing is milkshakes. I had a bagel (from local St Viateur bakery) with cream cheese, which came with a really fresh and tasty side salad. The service was friendly and efficient. I can't wait to go back!"
/user_details?userid=sRz1EUKZBalo2FHIAhdFuA,Daniel L.,"Oswego, NY",4 star rating,"The first place my wife and I visited in Montreal! There were a few other places on the way, but they were so busy and didn't take credit cards. Had a wonderful server who was very friendly and made us feel at home even though neither of us know the language well... at all. We shared an order of bacon poutine and I got the Bison burger on a beautiful toasted bun with melted brie, lettuce and tomato. Both were delish! The fries tasted fresh, the bacon was smokey and good, and the bison was cooked perfectly. Very fairly priced, a good start to our Montreal dining experience, good choice for just picking a place at random."
/user_details?userid=DRVEe9OZqBox9iWgFyB8SA,Krista M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I love this quirky little diner a hop skip from gorgeous Park Lafontaine. It's usually jammed on the weekends with the brunch crowd and I'm not often in that neighborhood but last week I went for lunch with a friend and was reminded how sweet that spot can be. Any place with booths generally wins me over (especially if they are red or black...) and Anecdote indeed has booths 1950's diner style and the back section also has a raised area with kitschy tables and chairs. The staff are friendly and attentive - this time round' the waitress quickly confirming there was no dairy in the soup of the day that my lactose-intolerant friend had ordered.Now I'm by no means a vegetarian but I remember going there for the veggie club and fries which was memorable. After scanning the comprehensive burger list (friends swear by their classic Anecdote burger and they have some other interesting options like 'cerf', 'bison' etc.) I settled on a tofu-dog all dressed and fries. It was exactly what I wanted and the whole meal was under $6.00! They also have a really adorable kids menu for $4.95 and under - so family-friendly as well. Things can get pricey though as sides are extra but generally the prices are reasonable for what you get. They also have many great breakfast options..."

/user_details?userid=mZ1gXzL6Tn5Oky8_j0Kp7g,Barbara D.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"So we arrived in Montreal late on a Friday night, and a relative brought us here. As soon as I spotted it, I fell in love! It looks like this is an actual diner from the 40's (they've kept the visual integrity/consistnacy of it. They have booths (!), the interior is fantastic and the staff are friendly and professional! Oh, and did I mention? I had the lamb burger - ABSOLUTELY THE BEST BURGER EVER!!!!!!!!!! Juicy, tender, succulent. MMMM!!! And the fries? Well, I'm not really a french fry person (I'm picky - need em well done, crispy exterior - none of that fakey mashed fast food inside) and they were great! Oh and they also serve you Coca-cola in those cute little (Coca-cola) bottles for an even more authentic experience. The prices are good as well. I want their burger now!! I can't want to go back!"
/user_details?userid=NuCYI_Ajnb3HULcHAnDA3w,Shirley G.,"Linden, NJ",5 star rating,Had the classic burger ... So on point! Try the poutine just because you are in Montreal and that is a staple in the town :-) My son loved it! Scraped his plate!
/user_details?userid=g17OV1xMXaHc6rM3aSJNtQ,Regueiro D.,"Irvine, CA",4 star rating,We went for late lunch. Ordered the burguer L'Anecdote number 4 and the salmon bagel. Delicious!
/user_details?userid=A7KaGGuusk7mlC7gr6Ljdw,K. T.,"Edmonton, Canada",4 star rating,"We like L'Anecdote a lot. It's not perfect (I'll get to that) but it serves a tasty burger and the staff are friendly and helpful. I've enjoyed every meal I've had there (although it's hard to order poutine when Banquise is just down the street) and their burgers and fries are delicious.The two drawbacks for me: the hours, and the drinks. L'Anecdote closes early for a place like this (Montrealers classically eat late), but that's basically forgivable. The real head-scratcher for me: no milkshakes on the menu! Very baffling for a place that prides itself on its status as a fifties-style diner.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend L'Anecdote; it would be third for me behind Paryse and Banquise, but for a warm bit of Montreal fast food it's hard to top."

We ordered 2 ham bourgeois and a moyenne poutine and 2 beers. IT TOOK THEM ONE HOUR TO BRING THE FOOD.They don't take CC so it ended up being quite expensive because the waitress helped herself on the tip!!!"
/user_details?userid=BjdJP6Os9fNAGzGH2AQvrA,Melissa C.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I was really looking forward to this super cute little diner. We went in for Breakfast. I made the mistake of ordering Serasin Crepes, they were terrible, and as a server myself I felt horrible but I could not eat these, and asked if I could have regular crepes instead. they weren't the best but much better then the Serasin. I was told that I still had to pay for the other plate. Shocked, as I never charge my clients for food they did not like after one bit. I kept my mouth shut. Not impressed by the staff, they obviously don't particularly care about the clients. This could be a  great place if they had better cooks."
/user_details?userid=U_iSakf73ZGSp0N2XmFVLQ,Will V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Anecdote is a cute little diner that strikes the perfect balance between cute and cheesy. The dining room is full of small, red vinyl booths, and short counter with about six stools. The walls are spotted with old black and white photos of indiscernible characters, and a vintage cash register sits at the end of the bar. Service was quick at first, and quite adamantly in french. Later into the meal it trailed off - we weren't offered a coffee until after our plates had been cleared. We were in for breakfast, and both of us opted for simple two egg plates (about $7 a piece including meat). The food was nothing special, although the potatoes were certainly homemade and tasty. I might opt for their slightly more extravagant lunch menu in the future. Overall, it was a fun experience. If you're looking for a traditional diner atmosphere with acceptably tasty, reasonably priced food, give l'anecdote a try."

Don't expect to settle in here with your friends for a night of milkshakes and hangouts.Service was kind of spotty. I had to get up to ask questions/get water, at least a couple of times.Worst thing of all: they fry everything in peanut oil!! BEWARE. If you have any friends who are allergic to peanuts, like one of mine, do not go here or s/he won't be able to eat! Most restaurants don't do this anymore. What's the deal?"
