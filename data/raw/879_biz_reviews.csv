/user_details?userid=Iu5mS8o02-RGpjJdxI0v7w,Harry K.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"So again, as an avid follower of my Yelp leader Jason M, I declared today to be a panini day. Trusting my hunch and the good reviews here, I drove about 25km from Laval all the way to Langelier street for a panini sandwich. Yeah I could be a wing nut sometimes but mind you, distance is just a meaningless number for me when food is involved. I'd travel to moon and back for good grub..... provided gas prices and traffic are reasonable that day. The place is fairly small with 3-4 tables only and a small island in the middle with few stools. It didn't feel crowded despite the fact there were some people enough to fill the place and perhaps also the rush hour had finished too? In any case, it felt comfortable and also felt like you're at a specialty store, not one of them places where they serve a slew of different kinds of food from all corners of the world with no specific specialty. Here, specialty is panini.Their menu has good varieties of panini choices and salads. After some soul searching by staring at the menu for about 10 minutes, I decided to eliminate chicken and went with their 12"" Marco's super special which had Italian sausages, thin slices of pork roast, fresh tomatoes, greens, hot sauce, melted cheese and... ummm, given my age, I forgot what other goodies; all nicely seated in a flaky, crunchy, yummy and easy to chew panini bread which was pressed to perfection. From the first to the last bite, I really enjoyed it and even though stomach was full to the brim, It somehow felt good, not bothered by the ample quantity it'd just received and most importantly no heartburns or other side effects after an hour or two of eating. Not sure about you, but this is my stomach's barometer telling me this food is of a very good quality. A word also about the staff and the owner: Very nice, smiling, polite and helpful people behind the counter not showing signs of stress or fatigue despite them being busy. You will feel at ease and not rushed into ordering nor that standard feeling you get these days of talking to a robot-like person such as at Tims and McDonald's for example. I'd come back for sure and try their other kick ass sandwiches with no hesitation... provided-see gas prices and traffic above. Quality, taste and price are in harmony. It cost me $15 with tax and tips for a 12"" panini trio which is pretty filling and satisfying. Bon mes amis, enough said, go and enjoy if in the mood for this type of food. You won't be disappointed! It's got Harry's seal of approval who thinks he's got good taste."

/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",5 star rating,"Holy smokes.  Italian subs? Yes please. Actually make that a double yes! First experience I had enjoying Italian subs was while I lived in Ottawa over ten years ago. I would frequent weekly a place called Dirienzo's. It's still there and delicious.  Dirienzo's introduced me to cuts such as capppicola, calabrese, and marinated eggplant between a bun with cheese and a cured Italian style cold cuts. Fast forward to 2016. Yes, here in Montreal we sure have lots of Italian descendants. So while in St Leonard one day I fired up my Yelp app and saw this gem. After two visits I'll declare it a top sandwich place. Maybe one of the best in MTL. On my first visit I had a Carlos Calabrese. It's a spicy sandwich. Hearty filling and flavour exploding in your mouth flavour. On my second visit I had a super Da Marco. Full of Italian cold cuts and Italian sausage w lettuce and tomato. Ask for it with spicy mayo. A delish kick. They offer to make it a full meal with green salad or macaroni salad. There are two sizes panini and sub. I've ordered the sub size twice and it's a filling lunch which comes in a shade under $15 with a beverage. Both times I've been here I've been welcomed with a hello and thanked for stopping in. Really incredible service and high quality sandwich eats. They also have salads on the menu. However if you are a sandwich person go with one of their many selections. I don't believe you will be dissapointed. Amazing stuff!"
/user_details?userid=FV-SJMp2o8xW07vWCiaiag,Sindeyrella ..,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great place, they've expanded their menu since they've opened. Their creatively named sandwiches are yummy & served with their special sauce. Unlike their sandwiches (6in or 12in), their salades are one size - and that size is enormous! Service is quick & staff(owner) are friendly. Good place for a weekday lunch."
/user_details?userid=j5AeiwJqXshetxXKiS9Yiw,Melanie A.,"North York, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Stumbled upon this gem thanks to Yelp reviews and couldn't recommend it more.   Marco welcomed and served us with genuine kindness and a clear passion for food and providing wonderful customer service.   Our sandwiches were amazing, and we loved the mayo/hot sauce on the side.   My husband and son also very much enjoyed their macaroni salad.  Strongly encourage anyone to support this small business!"
/user_details?userid=MP1FOTOyNMCfLTaEa6SBBQ,John C.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Where to start... Everything is fresh. Staff is friendly. Food is delicious. Your first time, either try the Tony's, the Super Marco or the secret menu Charlie's. When they ask if you want Mayo and Hotsauce, just nod yes. It's made in house and I swear you'd think there's nicotine in it. Calmly but firmly dip your panini into the Mayo Hotsauce and repeat. I try to go 2-3 times a week to keep my blood to mayo/Hotsauce ratio healthy."
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My favorite panini place in Montreal. Located where I grew up in St-Leonard in the East end you can find a small panini place where you can make custom choices to some amazing sandwiches. To your heart's content. Try Marco's Special or Frankie's Favorites and you'll come back here for sure. Its a nice cozy place, big enough to allow small groups to come and share their thoughts on these unique sandwiches.The owner is friendly and attentive and loves to talk with his clients. (He loves the Blackhawks!)The coffee, particularly the cappuccino is fantastic. Many choices of drink can be bought as well.Protip : Ask for a side order of their ""famous"" spicy mayo."
/user_details?userid=K0FpfBo7N5EIog3Mlh2ZYg,Claudia D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Milano's...MOVE OVER! Da Marco is THE go-to place if you want a real delicious Italian panini. I ordered the Marco's special and my sister ordered Pino's Prosciutto and both were amazing! The staff was friendly and courteous. They made me feel welcome the moment I walked through the door. The service was quick and efficient. If you're looking for a fast grab n' go option this place will meet your needs. Hit this place up if you're in the east end. I certainly can't wait to return.
/user_details?userid=j7Yc8wXMLohLyot1CgGrCQ,David G.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,Panini De Marco is amazing loved the sandwiches really homemade u can't go wrong and cheap prices.
/user_details?userid=hLgs_2OF9dMb_ksrE5ujgQ,Henry P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Good stuff, great service. The spicy mayo completes the delicious panini. The only thing that bothers me is that the macaroni salad on the plate is smaller than the take-out and that Perrier can cost an extra 2.75. I was full afterward considering it was a 16 meal. Conclusion -- Worth it"

What a friendly guy who really cares about more than just food but also the world! It was so nice to meet you and talk with you, and maybe we'll see you in Seattle someday!"
/user_details?userid=tuTOS6G6d3VjjVjnnMkuug,Niki S.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",2 star rating,"Clean place. Friendly. Sandwich was ok. I was not impressed by the two slices of meat, thin like paper tomato...Sandwich tasted more like bread. For the price I won't return."
/user_details?userid=S6WAo9h7PHqUDbog60pzjw,Joseph B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Just go! You won't be disappointed!Friendly prompt service and quality sandwiches! Did I mention fresh?!!
/user_details?userid=Q-o6TLtw9dogy3eWcYyVGA,Michael C.,"Saint Leonard, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Where do I start, my uncle owns the place, paninis are hella good and always packed with tasty meats and vegetables. Not to mention, the hot sauce infused with homemade mayo is a drug. If you haven't checked this place out, I surely recommend it; best sandwich place in Montreal without a doubt."
/user_details?userid=5JkrkzDxJ9U19dqY4_LQSg,Mike D.,"St-Leonard, Canada",4 star rating,"In my opinion this place is very underrated , they have a wide selection of pressed sandwiches including chicken, beef, and cold cuts, all there paninis have clever names like Charlie chicken, cute lol.  You can taste the freshness of the ingredients from the chicken to the thick cut tomatoes, salad and they have a special sauce which adds another layer of flavour. Try it out you won't be disappointed ."
