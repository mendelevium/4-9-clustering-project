I was super excited when they opened their location in Mtl. I remember going to their restaurant in Toronto over 2 years ago and was hoping that they would open a location here. My bf and I ordered their tonkatsu ramen for delivery and they were having a promo where you can get one slice of their mango cheesecake for free. Loved that you can choose to get to get your ramen packed separately from the broth or you could order it already in the broth. They also packed the utensils separately which was nice. The egg, noodles, and pork were perfect. The broth on its own was super flavourful! As soon as unpacking the soup from the bag you could already smell the flavour! Was alittle taken back by how small the slice of free cheesecake was (it looks way bigger in the pic!) But I won't complain as it was free.Hands down will be my go to for ramen now in Mtl. Highly recommend!!"

As a toronto kid, I knew sansotei made the best ramen in town. With bated breath, I waited until they were open for delivery, and now dine in is open!They didn't let me down! I went to pick up my takeout and then opted to dine in instead of in my cold lonely office. Since I was the only patron and all employees wore masks, I felt safe dining inside. The service was wonderful, they plated my ramen for me even though I ordered takeout. (i tipped!)Now let's talk about the ramen. It was everything I expected! The broth was rich, smooth, and not too salty. The pork was perfectly cooked and tender, seasoned delicately. Lastly, the thick noodle texture was exactly how I liked it, not too soft. The perfect bowl of ramen!TIP: Ordering on ubereats will cost you A LOT more even if you choose pickup! I learned the hard way after sitting down and seeing the menu. ORDER TAKEOUT AT THE STORE NOT ON SOME APP THAT TAKES A HUGE CUT"

/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Tried 4 different types of ramen broth. My fave was the miso black which was packed with flavor and was very comforting. The tantan was mostly salty and a bit spicy. The tomato was sour and salty and was the one i liked the least. You can choose between thin and thick noodles and each bowl comes with a piece of tender chashu. The fried chicken was delicious and very tasty. The place isn't big but the wait time wasn't too long. The staff are friendly and nice.
