/user_details?userid=OzwhuN_vueQKMPlfLPkG2Q,Anna D.,"Laval, Canada",3 star rating,"This was my first outing at a restaurant since Covid restrictions. As always, the food is delicious, And the service is very good. However I was very disappointed to see that the majority of the staff was not wearing their masks properly, often pulling them down while speaking to customers. They also allowed some people to enter the establishment without masks. The restaurant was as full as I've ever seen it. I'm not sure if proper precautions are being taken. (Should waiters be wearing gloves?)I was not very comfortable overall."
/user_details?userid=HQX84Yu7-70iXINB1s5pyw,Shima S.,"Irvine, CA",5 star rating,"An incredible experience with Lavi serving us. He is really good at what he does which adds to dining experience. The food was excellent and we just ordered whatever our waiter, Lavi decided for us. I had the octopus salad for appetizer and giant shrimps with crab and zucchini on a bed of risotto for the main course. All my other colleagues also loved their food. As we sat down they first brought us bruschetta on the house for everyone. Then they brought house made bread which was excellent. The appetizer sampler that is not on the menu is highly recommended. We were a group of 5 and they even brought us complimentary dessert since they screwed up one of the orders but quickly fixed it. The creme brûlée was soOverall it was a very memorable experience! Dined for 3 hours there and time went by like a breeze."
/user_details?userid=_Ntg87ugjBw6IFy29_EGqg,Gino B.,"Montréal-Nord, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Amazing evening. The service and food here is above expectations. Had a delicious mixed platter for an appetizer with business colleagues. It had calamari, prosciutto, buratta, and a small lamb chop per person. My main was a linguine pescatore which is a signature dish at this restaurant. A little pricey but well worth and highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=Y6JhHLPzBZ6Z5cHS1s-B4w,Rojarra T.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,"A friend and I visited Da Vinci for lunch last week and let me tell you, it was one of the best decisions that I made! As we walked in, we were greeted warmly by our waiter, Carlos. He's personable, hilarious and you can tell that he loves his job. The restaurant is gorgeous and beautifully decorated w/white decor. There's lots of space; they have multiple dining rooms and spaces for private events.My friend and I both ordered from the lunch menu. There's a sample menu on their website, however it's not fixed and changes based on what's available. For my appetizer, I ordered a Penne Beef Bolognese and for my main, I had Filet Mignonette with vegetables and potatoes. My friend ordered an Arugula salad with freshly shaved Parmesan for her appetizer and Rack of Lamb with vegetables and potatoes for her main dish. Not only was everything flavoured and presented perfectly, but for an appetizer and main, it ONL cost 27.50 (before tax + tip).Restaurant Da Vinci has nailed the fine dining experience; the service, decor, ambiance and of course the food all deserve 10/10!"
/user_details?userid=wPtIgmWQD-7IXodmCwPlCA,Richard W.,"Reading, VT",5 star rating,"Up from Vermont with a group of four for a very special celebratory meal.  We could not have chosen a better place for this special occasion. Lavi was an incredible host who really took the time to make us feel like welcomed guests. The service and attention to detail was top notch. And of course the food and wine was world class! Truly one of the best meals we have ever had and one of the finest dining experiences as well. We recommend the ravioli with crab, gnochi, lamb chops and sea bass. But really, anything you get here is likely to be great. Lavi took us off menu and basically catered a unique meal we will probably never duplicate. And the desserts were heavenly!"
/user_details?userid=E9YxPGI3rZP-pQFbjRS-Og,Darcy F.,"Halifax, Canada",5 star rating,"Fantastic service and amazingly delightful food make this one of our new favourite spots in Montreal. Great atmosphere and attention to detail. The pasta dish we had was exquisitely zesty, and the ribeye cut was bursting with more flavour than any we've had at a full on steakhouse. Our servers, and in fact the entire staff we dealt with, were all highly attentive, made great suggestions without solicitation, and were welcoming and friendly. We capped off our great night here with the Semifreddo, and what a great bow on the evening. Deliciously decadent and exactly the right amount. We'll be looking forward to another great meal here on our next visit!"
/user_details?userid=tBjK-sFxafl0Ek1di0qpgg,Kirk T.,"Methuen, MA",5 star rating,My wife and I came in to MTL on our way home from stops in Ontario. We needed a spot to make up for a lackluster experience a few days ago. Our server Carlo and the staff at Da Vinci went above and beyond. Carlo was willing to explain the menu to us and offer suggestions. He made us feel at home and was beyond patient. We ate and enjoyed the ambiance in delight. He was personable and took a genuine interest in our experience. Go there for the food and be pleased by the service.

We all had a really great experience and loved our food and LOVED our waiter, however, we were taken back from our waiter's assistant or helper or whatever he was...While he was walking by, I asked for lemons with the water... and he never responded so I asked one more time and he responded with, ""OK I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME"" .... we were all so shocked and looked at each other with disbelief and just let it be....Then the second time, he dropped utensils on us while walking by and he didn't even say sorry or anything and just kept it moving ... He then started coming around handing out our food, and when I said Oh thats mine!, he responded with ""yeah I KNOW.""....He completely ruined our dining experience with his grumpy ass attitude and rude ass responses... I wish he wasn't even around because we were all so annoyed of him and his disrespect. Later on in the night, when we talked to the girls at the other side of the table, they said they had the same negative experience with that same guy..I don't think I would recommend this place nor ever go back here."
/user_details?userid=ixrw6DSZY0Qzigvfv1SC0w,Franchesca G.,"Oakland, CA",5 star rating,"This restaurant was amazing!  We're greeted warmly, our server Carlo was so kind and walked us through our choices.  We shared the porcini ravioli and the cavatelli which were delicious.  We also shared the baked bass which was so delicious and moist.  Carlo advised us wisely on the wine selection, we're a little demanding because we have some experience with wines, and he helped us pick the right wine.  We had such a wonderful time at this wonderful and we strongly recommend it."

Way overpriced for what you get.The food is good, but its the same quality you can get elsewhere for a much more reasonable price.And the servers are retarded or had traumatic brain injuries. (TBI)"
/user_details?userid=e81vR1Fo1xez8_UMrYH1XQ,Isabella F.,"Miami, FL",5 star rating,"Absolutely incredible! I wish I could give more than five stars. For starters the restaurant is beautiful and was recently remodeled. The service is impeccable and better than any other restaurant I've ever been to in Montreal. The menu is extensive and offers a variety of options for any palate. We followed along with all the recommendations and from start to finish it was a wonderful gastronomic experience. Words will never be enough so if you get the chance to dine at this restaurant - take it. You will not regret it. I will definitely be back in the near future. This is officially one of my Montreal favorites. Special thanks to Lavi, Carlo and Vince for your hospitality and for such an incredible night."
/user_details?userid=YkMsjZBN0jqw83FgEsgyfA,Jessi V.,"Middlebury, VT",5 star rating,"As tourists in Montreal from the US, we were not informed of the best restaurants in the region. We heard about this restaurant through word of mouth and it was an excellent choice. We were greeted with unrivaled service, especially from our waiter Lavi. He was extremely helpful with deciphering the menu and pairing our meals with wine. Our meals were delicious and beautiful, well worth the price. I highly recommend allowing the knowledgeable staff to guide your meal choices. If you're looking for Italian in Montreal, this is definitely a great option."

I don't think there were any scraps at the end of the night and I got big high fives from my buddies on an excellent choice.Awesome spot!"

If you have a car, make sure to find parking on your own as the valet service kinda seemed like a rip-off. There was a bread and sausage plate served to us which tasted fresh. It is a bit on the pricey side however I feel that the service, ambiance, and good quality makes up for it. Definitely a must try if you're in the mood for Italian in Montreal!"

Superb food and they nicely (no attitude!) made a meat dish into a vegetarian option to please me.  Delightful all around and Carlo was SUPERB in every way.  Kind, generous, clearly wanting us to have an exceptional experience-- mission accomplished!  A few more vegetarian options on the menu would be smart and appreciated (as the vegetarian movement is growing in leaps and bounds). Aside from that, perfection all around. Grazie mille, Carlo!"

Fresh and home made gnocchis (ricotta); burrata, mozarella di Bufala - so fresh, moist and soft; my boyfriend had the lamb and beef carpaccio - tender, cooked to perfection, and carpaccio was just melting in his mouth w the perfect amount of parmesan... Good thing is that you can ask for half portions of pastas. Service : excellent. The waiters make you feel important."

As soon as we sat down our waiter Lavi was about as pleasant as you could possibly be. He knows the menu in and out and had absolutely flawless food/ wine recommendations. The food was phenomenal yes, but it was the service that really made me want to come back; which I will certainly do in the nearby future. If you want a dinner where not only the service and atmosphere but food is spectacular then I strongly suggest coming to davincis!"
/user_details?userid=dcQKSttXOI77gAoy_820tw,Tatiana H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The food is good, but overpriced. For similar type of food and crowd, I would go to Bis(located on de la Montagne) or Beatrice for the younger crowd.The restaurant caters for an older crowd, but is nice for special events when you don't want an overcrowded restaurant.I was disappointed with my creme brûlée, the caramel crust was not thick enough and I've had better.Good place, good food but would not particularly go back.(if you are a foodie, this is not the place for you)"
/user_details?userid=V3S9ykTLFiEd2duzZaPFYQ,Anna S.,"Dallas, TX",1 star rating,"VERY DISAPOINTED! I looked up the menu online. I called a few days ahead to make sure that it's the regular menu for Formula One weekend, they said yes but a couple of dollars more per plate. It wasn't! It was half of the regular menu, most of what we don't eat (we're a group of 6!) and only the most expensive plates! Very, very disappointing!the food was ok, absolutely NOT worth the price, really!And there was no ambiance, no music, no life for a Grand Prix weekend"

The waitstaff was exemplary, the atmosphere was dead on for romance. Service was timed perfectly, our mixed drinks were substantial and done very well. When our dinner arrived it was perfect and we had a personal visit from the owner who was very attentive to our opinions. We will definitely be coming back time and time again!!"

We left giving a BIG tip & smiling from ear to ear.It goes without saying we will be back.One minus is that you get charged for water ($8.50), so I won't be getting that next time."
/user_details?userid=yUWIjQHYOHbTrY0l-UgB_g,Maya A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It's a very old classical, romantic restaurant. However.... 1) as soon as we sat down, waiting for a few people to arrive.. we didn't have a waiter coming to our table and asking us if we wanted to start off by a drink.:. I mean water could be nice.. after 30 mins he came and we asked for water .. he poured each one of us , a quarter of water in each cup. I mean come on it's TAP WATER!2) the service was really slow. And it wasn't even packed. It took us another hour to order our dishes. 3) I ordered the gnocchi, which was very good ( also why I put a 3 stars and not a one.. the food there was excellent, all of us enjoyed it- I'm getting too distracted) however my food was cold. I didn't wanna be over tight, so didn't say anything until I heard another friend say the same thing. Told the waiter and gave me a huge bitchy face.. he didn't seem very pleasant with my comment. He's like the plate is warm though, but that doesn't mean the food is... 4) my highlight of the night is someone got engaged. It was so cute!!! Overall food is actually good but service is horrible."
/user_details?userid=nUemlwbg6iMTTOdxEh3NfQ,Nirav S.,"Livingston, NJ",2 star rating,Our group of 6 was really looking forward to a seemingly wonderful dinner here based on others reviews of the food. The problem is we waited for 20 minutes for someone to even let us know what the status was with our 9pm reservation. Everyone that was waiting ahead of us was seated and we were still kept waiting as the staff zoomed past with no acknowledgement that we were all still there. We decided to leave and try our luck elsewhere and were fully satisfied with our next restaurant choice. Frustrating that our reservation was not honored but maybe i'll try to give it a shot again soon wth a smaller party.
/user_details?userid=EXKAPY0klEaXXR_j_1pRTQ,David W.,"Edmonton, Canada",4 star rating,White table cloth traditional service.  Quiet sophisticated atmosphere appropriate for meeting the parents of your sons girlfriend.  Beautiful decor feels like old home.   Food is of high quality sufficient but not over sized portions.   Had a large multi course meal and did not feel stuffed.  Veal shank on risotto was excellent.  Mushroom tagaltelli with pancetta was memorable.
/user_details?userid=qydyCAcUSZY-0F5hl9vr3w,Alexandra D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The food was good, but a bit overpriced.

/user_details?userid=JYdRjTKORzYLJokAYN1RbA,Blair J.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"Seeing that I'm not a fan of Italian food [I know, crazy]--this place was A+. The place was empty and the atmosphere was a little bleak but the waiter was attentive and the food was excellent.I ordered an 'off-menu' item: risotto with porcinis and truffles: perfect, perfect.My lovely date had something similar to pasta carbonara, except it wasn't as cream heavy.The wine list was bank...most wines were well over $60-70.Overall, a good meal and I'd probably come back if I was in Montreal--and needing an Italian fix."

With the help of a few champagne bottles, it was a memorable night out for us. The staff was accommodating, the chef even came out in the end to chat and made us a special dessert. We loved the atmosphere, it was classy and romantic. Make sure to come with a big wallet though ;) Located in the heart of downtown Montreal, it was walking distance from our hotel Le Crystal which was perfect!"

The atmosphere, the food, and service were exceptional. Our waiter, Levi, was incredibly attentive and met every single need/want for the evening. He spent time getting to know what we liked and did not like and made recommendations for us based on what he learned. It wasn't just Levi who was personable and professional. The entire staff was working together like a well oiled machine and helped make the experience wonderful! So thank you everyone at Da Vinci...you made a dinner into a highlight for our trip. If you could not tell, I highly recommend this restaurant!"

Everything here is perfection, from the service to the food to the decor (well, from my two visits).  On our latest visit, our coats were taken up arrival, and when seated, we were served a small plate a cured meats, cheese, and bruschetta. I had the table d'hôte, and ordered the buffalo mozzarella, tomato and prosciutto salad. The prosciutto was nicely crisped and set atop the tomatoes and cheese.. yum!  I also had the risotto with shrimp and crab - it was creamy and flavourful (my boyfriend had the steak and lobster tail). Everything was delicious! For dessert, we had the cannoli/creme brule duo - I loved the combination of creamy creme brule and crisp cannoli! The only downside is being automatically served bottled water that you didn't ask for, and being charged $9 a bottle. Other than that, highly recommend."

I was really tempted to take pictures of it... my uncle advised against it.It's been awhile since my visit, so I'm not sure how much I remember. My entree was a mushroom risotto - it was very nice. I don't remember what my appetizer was, but I remember really liking it.Sorry, my review isn't very helpful because it's been so long!

Staff is amazingly friendly, and very helpful. Dined here one night it was so crowded, they seated us upstairs in a closed section so we could relax and eat. A real family feel to this place, the entrees are superb (they even give you free chef tastings) and the tiramisu is the best I had ever tasted. Check out the self cleaning toilet seats in the bathroom. This place is a real treat!"
/user_details?userid=WR3eZ4tuyXaRWC2epO7EhA,Gio G.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Holy wow! Ok... I had spent a good week wining and dining in Montreal and our concierge recommended this place for a great Italian meal. Though I found that most of their dishes were not truly authentic (being Italian and all), I was still impressed by their presentation and how fresh the food tasted. Their tomato and mozzarella salad was to die for! It tasted as if the tomato was picked right off the vine and their buffalo mozzarella nearly melted in my mouth, bursting with fresh flavor. I had their stuffed shrimp with crab on top of risotto for my main course. The risotto was a tad bit undercooked but the shrimp was exquisite in flavor which completely made up for that minor detail. The waitstaff was superb. Allowing us to enjoy every course of the meal and keeping our wine glasses filled (you will be quite intimidated by their wine list... bottles ranging from $45- $1000), they were attentive and friendly.The atmosphere was elegant and romantic (bring your date here!!!). We went on a Friday night and were surprised that the restaurant wasn't packed at all. But in my opinion, I would rather come when there's less people to fight for a table. Overall, my experience here was great and I would most definitely eat here the next time I'm in town!"
