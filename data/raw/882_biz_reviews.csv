All components were delicious and delicately arranged for truly something special. It's also served with an almond milk (maybe house made??) chai; so perfect. For my partner they brought out a vegan special and he similarly thought it was fantastic.The space feels like going home- the decor is unique and clearly a collection of fun things acquired by someone who loves the restaurant. Although small, it's warm and intimate. Absolutely perfect for the chill November morning we stumbled upon it."
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A true gem. Fabulous for brunch. I always order the ""Special"" which consists of 4 small plates: an omelet (moist, switching up ingredients from week to week), a house cured fish, a yogurt parfait, and a small desert. The perfect quantity of food for most folks I think... You'll leave satisfied, energized, and ready to make the most of your day. The meal comes w a lovely chai tea w almond milk. A steal for $20 w tax and tip!They also do dinner on Friday nights - though you must reserve advance. This meal is great, healthy, and relatively light. Also a great deal.Place is a bit under the radar and I suspect the owner-chefs (who are sweet folks!) prefer it that way. I certainly do."
/user_details?userid=hkCJqpgCP66qrjRfTdgXuw,Sam F.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"Great option if you are in the area.  We enjoyed a lovely early winter, weekday lunch with sunlight pouring in. Alas, there was no vegetarian main course option but the squash opener and dessert was delicious for my veggie gal.  I thoroughly enjoyed my salmon n spinach dish!Very cool to watch the chef smoothly and efficiently move through the kitchen to work his magic. There is *just* enough seating for folks to be friendly with their neighbors if they wish, or just enjoy a quiet lunch themselves.  The server doubles as back of house as well, but ably managed her business and kept it moving.  I could totally see being a regular of a place like this, as I am sure the chef rotates things on a regular basis, and it would be a great place to take a break, soak up some light and enjoy a delicious multicourse lunch for a reasonable price.  FYI - the neat pics of multicourse options you see with omlettes is a weekend, brunch only thing, so plan accordingly.Note - on the day we visited they were cash-only, which could be a permanent thing, or their machine was broken.  One of the few spots we ran into this, so we were prepared, but FYI - pull some cash from the ATM in the supermarket lobby around the corner and settle in for a relaxed meal."

/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"Was in the area and starving this weekend, tried to go to the Patisserie Rhubarbe sugar shack but they ran out of sandwiches and we were too hungry to wait in line for just sweets, and there was a line at Byblos too, and just when things looked hangry and grim: Yelp to the rescue. We found it on the app, and popped around the corner into this unmarked, tiny, bright little room. We were served hot almond milk chai as soon as we sat down, and then we devoured incredibly tart and delicious rhubarb French toast, salmon gravlax, goat cheese and wild mushroom omelettes, yogurt with homemade granola, all so good and healthy and chill and friendly. A great find, not fancy, no room for crowds, just a few round wooden tables and a calm smiling vibe."
/user_details?userid=-KpEgEen1tj-jdjIS7uVOw,Isabelle R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Kind of like a set menu- about 6 choices, one of them being ""la surprise"" - a mix of a lot of the menu offerings in smaller portions, great idea! They start you off with a cup of chai tea followed by some delicious yogourt & granola, a melt in your mouth buttery omelet and some salmon gravlax. It was all very good, and the two member cooking/serving team were friendly and laid back. Really feels like stepping into someone's morning kitchen, very neighbourhood vibe with friendly greetings all around. Small cons: There was no music playing which made the silent background noise of pots and pans a little awkward. And it was quite pricy - 44$ for two (including tip & tax), but with no cocktails or coffees. Also, it's cash only."
/user_details?userid=zjtGkDaZkQZiX536I3FFpg,Tatiana A.,"Minneapolis, MN",4 star rating,"A cute and charming tiny little place! We had breakfast here, and everything was fantastic. A bit on the expensive side, but well worth it for this incredible organic gourmet experience. I wished for coffee (they serve only tea), but happily, I was told I could go next door to get coffee and was welcome to bring it in. Get the ""Suprise"", it was a bit of everything on their menu for the day and gave s great taste of their talents. The chef cooks right behind the counter and watching him meticulously plate was an enjoyable part of the whole experience. Would definitely recommend if creative, gourmet and organic are words dear to your heart!"

/user_details?userid=kuksFR1R8gCUvvhcSWMpjw,Mark H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"My favourite restaurant in Montreal. The most charming place with unforgettable food. The starter is always fantastic - in the winter time there's almond milk chai in giant carafes to warm the bones. I love this little secret place and almost don't want to review it and give it away! But these folks deserve all your love, so go go go!"

/user_details?userid=bQcPcvGP7cLpCwzUoa-JwQ,Luke J.,"Saint Louis, MO",3 star rating,"This place came highly recommended by some friends of my wife and so we decided to stop in for lunch on a recent trip to Montreal. The place is tiny, only a couple of tables, only four items on the menu. Like most of the food I ate while in Montreal the emphasis clearly is on freshness and not so much on seasoning. In my short visit to Canada I came to believe that is there style of cooking, where my American tastes enjoy greater amounts of seasoning. I realize that is simply my taste and don't hold that against them.Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly young woman who spoke quiet, unsure English where we only spoke very broken French. Again that was on me, no points off there. We were immediately served a thick, creamy carrot soup with olive bread that again, was very fresh, just could of really used some black pepper. From the four item menu I ordered the Hot Cheese (Fromage Chaud?) and was served rather generous sized rounds of very decadent, soft cheese on thin layers of toast with a side salad with a mustard-y viniagrette. The salad was enjoyable, all the flavors very nice, but the ratio of cheese to bread was so great that I couldn't eat very much of the dish it was just so decadent. Maybe it was because I'd just had the creamy carrot soup but it was just so heavy I had to get 3/4 of it to go. Had it been served with more bread or maybe a sprig of grapes or just anything to cut through the extreme richness of the two dishes would of helped immensely.Now all that being said my wife absolutely loved the place. She had the salmon and would give it 5 stars I'm sure. Neat little place definitely but even with a whole bagel the next morning at breakfast to help balance the remaining cheese I still couldn't finish it."

Will certainly be coming back"
/user_details?userid=mely8w4HtWpyV2mu7Mz16g,Vikram N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is an absolute gem! It's very understated - located in a residential area just off Laurier. In fact, the place does not even display its name on the outside (as far as I could tell), so you'd really have to know it's there.Inside, it's not a particularly large restaurant. There are only four tables and the max. seating capacity is probably around 15. We got lucky as some people were leaving just as we arrived. This was on a Sunday afternoon in mid-January, so I'd assume that it will be much more crowded in the summer. One of the really nice and unique things about Le Sain Bol is that the kitchen is open and you can watch the food being prepared. From scratch. Because they're a small restaurant, the way the chef cooks feels very homely. We saw him whisking eggs for an omelette in a small bowl, just like you'd do at home. Even the kitchen itself looks like something you'd have in your apartment, with a stove, oven, cabinet etc.As I gather, there's no set menu, it changes regularly depending on the season. The menu while I was there had six options - Gravlax (fresh salmon marinated for 48 hours in something - I don't remember what exactly!), Yoghurt with granola, Omelette, French Toast, a salad and a ""surprise"", which is essentially a taster menu incorporating a bit of all the available options.Le Sain Bol is very vegetarian-friendly, with most options always being vegetarian - the exception being their salmon, according to the server.Service was remarkably quick (or perhaps time flies by faster when you're watching it being made), and the food was great. Both myself and my companion ordered the taster menu. It should be noted that they are remarkably flexible with dietary requirements and have no problems switching out parts of the dish for something else, regardless of whether you eat vegetarian, gluten-free or something else. Everything I tried there tasted really fresh and wholesome - particularly the omelette which was so good that I really wanted to ask the chef how he made it!Overall, a great place for people seeking a different brunch experience in Montreal. I highly recommend!"
/user_details?userid=bCC9m7vuNKISQ-ckJ98fJQ,She H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This tiny restaurant is such a gem! We had their special which has been described multiple times already. I loved the food presentation. The portions were not huge, but the variety was great. We had a constant refill of their warm almond drink, which was fantastic for a chilly day. The place is very calming, we really did not feel rushed in any way. A great place to come spend quality time with friends!It is cash only, I believe, so do come prepared!"
