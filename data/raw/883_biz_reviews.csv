We had theatre tickets for 8 p.m. in the neighbourhood and, because of a big snowstorm, we were an hour later than planned for dinner. We walked in at 7:25 and they had our food sitting in front of us 5 minutes later. Unfortunately the food left a lot to be desired. Quantity was good and it was served piping hot, but even for a ""Qu√©becois-style Asian"" resto, the food didn't taste remotely like we were expecting. I ordered a Thai-style curry (in coconut milk) and it tasted like it was flavoured with supermarket yellow curry powder mix. No coconut taste, no ginger/lemongrass/fish sauce/sweet salty spicy Thai goodness. My husband's chicken stir-fry had big strips of chicken, but it was that rubbery seasoned kind. We wanted to like this place, but we likely won't be back."

The portion were small but the food was absolutely mediocre so it kind of cancels each other. Seriously, for the price of any other places the food looked and felt very old (fried tofu looked like something i forgot that dried up behind the fridge, the vermicelli were cold and everything was all together blend). Never again."
