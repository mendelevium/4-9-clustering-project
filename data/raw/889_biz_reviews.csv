/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,Delicious sushi. They serve all my favourites and the prices are decent. Service is also great (fast and friendly).The avocado is fresh and the rice is the perfect consistency. Most people get to go so you won't have any trouble finding a seat. It's very similar to another sushi I frequent and love though so not sure how often I will visit this one.
/user_details?userid=UEhKQKMXGm-eOMvM-QD-AQ,Holly R.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"I was a bit shocked by the quality here after reading the other reviews. I've never had sushi before where it was so clear they were trying to minimize the amount of fish used. The sushi pizza, for instance, came out with the thinnest little slice of salmon. I was also a little concerned that everything that was prepared for us (we were the only people there) was done in the microwave. I've never seen this before at a sushi restaurant? Our waitress was nice, but I just couldn't come back to somewhere where it felt like the food was so cheaply prepared."

/user_details?userid=HsE_C6THMN38fnIu_asAhA,Vikky Y.,"Laval-des-Rapides, Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"Easily some of the best sushi I've ever had, cute little place and polite service. Service is slightly slow but only because the sushi is being made freshly. Very good."
/user_details?userid=4iD4HjZQgI0cSaZ8r4YvsQ,Myles C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"First, Montreal isn't Japan and we don't have an 80 year old master sushi chef in town. Know what? This place doesn't purport to be. When I want takeout sushi, I want clean, quick, and tasty. The California roll tastes like a California roll, the price is reasonable, and the food is well made.When I'm looking for good, quick, cheep, and unpretentious (a rarity in Mile End), Fiji's my new place."
