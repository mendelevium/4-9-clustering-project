I had the opportunity to visit for Yelp Elite Week. This review is for a take out order due to COVID restrictions. La Méditerranée is a beautifully decorated restaurant. Everything from the furniture to the art on the walls look meticulously chosen and it's all so aesthetically pleasing. I can't wait to visit and actually eat lunches here since the seating looks so comfortable! Their food selections include juices, salads, bowls and paninis. I got to try their Mykonos salad with chicken and purchased a second Atlantis salad for my partner. Both were very fresh and they do not skimp out on the quality ingredients. They were so generous with their servings! Both salads were flavourful and filling. Service was great! They were attentive and let me know how ordering works. The salads were made quickly and efficiently. COVID: they follow the restrictions and there's a hand sanitizer as you enter. Everyone is wearing masks."

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was how beautiful and detailed the interior was. The pillows, plants and lights were so so cute!! I really felt like I was stepping into a Mediterranean vacation. The food was also soo delicious. I tried the miconos salad and I was blown away! The ingredients were fresh and the mix was incredibly tasty. The salad consisted of lettuce, feta cheese, bulgur, zaatar pita chips, kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers and shallot French dressing. Honestly, what a combo!To top off my experience, the staff were so kind and welcoming. I had no idea what to try off the menu so they recommended the Miconos salad and I was not disappointed!! I had an amazing experience at this restaurant and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone looking for some good Mediterranean cuisine! A true 5 star experience :)"

Cute decor and very conveniently located near the Square Victoria metro, so you can visit even on snowy days such as today.My friend and I started with appetizers of hummus and baba ghanoush, which came with some veggies for dipping and crisp pita chips. We loved that the hummus wasn't oily and the baba ghanoush had a brightness to it, which complemented the smokiness. Then we dug into our bowls; I had a salade niçoise and my buddy had the salmon tzaziki. I loved the salad! The tuna was a big portion, and not of cheap quality. There was a nicely hard-boiled egg and a selection of veggies, plus a great vinaigrette to top it all off. I love a good salad, and this was a great salad. The salmon came with a generous portion of tangy tzaziki, roasted vegetables, and a bed of quinoa. It was quickly devoured and declared to be excellent!I would happily return any day to try their other selections, they all looked and smelled delicious."

They do catering for offices and if you're located in the neighborhood, any order for 10+ people gives you a 15% discount! The decor is warm and inviting.  Looks like a great place to grab lunch and chat with a friend."
/user_details?userid=nEfgsjRDRmxx7nNFVZi0jw,Darryl R.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Excellent spot for lunch in Old Montreal. We got the Marrakech and Atlantis salads, both of which were excellent and abundant. The home-brewed Kobucha was the star. Fortunately, we were able to get the last two bottles. They have counter service, but also wait staff to take your order and bring your food to one of the few tables. However, you have to go to the counter to tell them what you ate and pay - which is unusual. Would definitely return"
