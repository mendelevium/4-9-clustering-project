The fish and batter are delicate in flavor; the spices are to be found in the homemade sauce that they put on the side. I took the tartar one - the classical pairing for that dish - and it was excellent.The ambiance is great, restaurant looks great, just like the terrace. Service was solid, albeit a bit slow; then again, when food is that cheap and the restaurant offers take out, all on a tuesday night, it was more than reasonable.Only thing that fell a bit flat were the fries. You have to salt them yourselves, and without being great, they aren't bad either. You can always have the salad on the side, with or without the fries as well, which is good.All this being said, I strongly recommend you check it out.---------------------------------------------------- Très bon fish & chips à un très bon prix. Le poisson lui-même et sa panure ont un goût délicat, on retrouve plus d'épices dans la sauce servie séparément. J'ai pris la sauce tartare - qui accompagne normalement les fish & chips - et elle était excellente.L'ambiance et le décor sont réussis, tant à l'intérieur du restaurant que sur la terrace. Le service était simple et efficace, bien qu'un peu lent. Ceci étant dit, quand la nourriture est à aussi bon prix, qu'ils offrent également pour emporter et qu'il s'agit d'un mardi, il faut s'attendre à ça, et c'est très raisonnable.Seul bémol: les frites. Il faut les saler soi-même (peut-être est-ce une bonne chose pour certains) et sans être mauvaises, elles ne sont pas géniales non plus. On peut toutefois les accompagner ou encore les substituer pour une salade, qui est bonne.Pour toutes ces raisons, je recommande fortemment l'endroit."

Allthough the fish & chips are very good (you can tell it is very fresh), the calamaris were amazing. I would go back just for the calamaris.We did notice that when entering, there was a weird smell, could be because of the fish, which is ok I guess. But you can tell that they work with very fresh products."
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"When I first came to this location they pretty much through a paper menu at us and walked to the back so we decided that it was time for us to leave.However this time around I walked in and was greeted by a friendly brunette who came to bring me water right away as I was waiting for the boyfriend.We were craving fish and chips ( DUH ) But instead we got a the trying plate which consisted of calamari, one piece of fish, 2 tempura shrimp and 2 fish croquette. They make their own mayos so when you order that you get all 6 of them. My favs were the curry and thai.We decided to get 2 hot dogs which are all beef not like la belle pro not knocking them or anything but you can taste it after your first bite. Only thing I would have to say is that they need to add more coleslaw and onions because it's a bit slim on toppings. The bun was great.The poutine was okay for $4.25 it's vegetarian sauce but the fries were a bit burnt so it wasn't the best but I'm glad I tried it.Tips for the resto: cut the fish smaller as the pieces are way to big.Don't charge 50 cents for a lemon slice ( cmon )And keep playing all the old school dirty 90's rap. Because some of the songs I haven't heard in a while and it was fun! I will be back tho."
/user_details?userid=kk3YK4AX3k1bCFi9STwFgA,Chaya F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Without a doubt the best fish & chips in verdun. Portions are generous, fish always tastes fresh, crispy, and not too greasy. My only complaint is that every time I go back they've raised the prices! Last time I went here (about six months ago), two pieces of cod, a salad, and fries would set you back about $17. Now that same combo costs $23. If you want to spend less than $50 for two (with tax) on what is widely considered a working class staple, I suggest getting a two-piece cod and sharing. Last time, instead of fries, my boyfriend and I received tiny French-fried crumbs - clearly whatever was left in the fry basket. Staff are friendly and warm."
/user_details?userid=N0LfSpP4RNS9t3GwIcuNxA,Hope P.,"Hollywood, FL",4 star rating,"Delish! Fried fish and seafood is the specialty here. I had a good experience at Comptoir 21 in Verdun with my family.A terrace (patio) set up outside on to the street with a sun tarp. Walking in and a huge circular bar to the left with bar stools set up ready to serve. There were no tables outside, nor booth seats available so we all sat at the bar. Two toddlers included and a high chair for the Third toddler.The service was a little slow to get our orders because there were two employees to work the entire restaurant. I saw customers get up from the booths to pay their bill at the bar. The employees had to deal with the change and completed checks before tending to us.We ordered Fish and chips for the kids which comes one piece of fish and fries for 6$Fried Calamari, A regular 2 Fish and Chips which is two portions of fish, fries, malt vinegar Coleslaw and Tartar sauce. My father ordered a steak sandwich which is his regular order here it comes with sauteed peppers, he added a side salad, and my sister ordered the Vegetarian Burger which has some Indian spices in it.The food came out pretty quickly after we ordered, great news because we were hungry!Fried calamari had all rings of tender squid pieces came out with lemon wedges and.a green tartar sauce.This calamari is really yummy soft, not chewy at all, so good tastes like butter popcorn. My two pieced Fish and Chips had a delicious tartar sauce with it too. This sauce is green and wasn't sure on the flavor but its Parsley! So Tasty! Parsley Aioli to dip the Fish and even fries in!  The deep golden beer battered light crust was perfection. The fish was light and flaky too, there was no excess oil I recommend this fried fish! Best part is they offer Malt vinegar in a spray bottle, and white vinegar in the spray bottle as well, so smart and fun!The fries were golden brown dark color but tasted like nothing! The Yelp reviews were dead on, these fries need improving, and seasoning.There are two other locations of Comptoir 21 in Montreal proving they know what they're doing. I would come back and order the Calamari again and try the fried shrimp ."

/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",3 star rating,Took the half fish portion with tartar sauce. Sauce was kinda tasteless but the fish was pretty fresh.Also took an entrée of fried calamari with this sauce - pretty big portion for $5.95.I like the long go around wood counter.
/user_details?userid=M9hLX0XhpJO3oNdCjlsvaw,Jordan K.,"LaSalle, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Not a bad place to grab a quick burger or fish and chips! Excellent look too! Just like an old diner. Miss these places! The service was nice friendly as well, so that's always a plus! Brought my girlfriend here and she seemed to like it, so good for a little date."
/user_details?userid=-OwkM7YDnPbwGxiKd7rptw,Jeff G.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Disclaimer: I ordered take out and have not yet eaten in the restaurant. That said, my experience was not appetizing at all. The fish was beyond oily (see picture) and was quite smelly (fresh fish should not have a ""fishy"" scent). There was clearly no seasoning on the fish, nor in the batter, as it was entirely bland. The fries were also unseasoned... Always salt fries when they come out of the fryer - that's basic technique. Overall, a highly disappointing meal. I'd say I'd give this place another try, but my colleagues say they've eaten in the restaurant and had the very same experience. I blame them for not warning me ahead of time. Folks, this is my warning to all of you!!! P.S.: check out the picture of the new menu."
/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Verdun just got a little bit better.Comptoir 21 recently opened its third location on Verdun's increasingly trendy, but still underneath the radar screen, Wellington Avenue. Sitting on the corner of 4th Avenue across the street from a vintage/retro shop, British Fish & Chips has found  a new place to hang its hat. Painted a light blue, sticking to the sea-based theme,  this Comptoir probably has the longest retro, chrome dining bar I've seen in a while.You cannot go wrong with the Fish and Chip, but if that's not your thing, you're not out of luck either. With burgers, salads, fried calamari, poutine, hot dogs and clam chowder, this is a wonderful place to either come by for a meal when you're not in the mood to cook or pick up and take away, which is going to be fun during the summer months since Verdun's bucolic riverside is literally a block away.Really friendly service, the place already has the hum of a great neighborhood eatery.Come check it out the next time you're in this bend in the river!"
/user_details?userid=qVRavGPFSpCarN21vCOHRw,Pierre R.,"Montréal, Canada",5 star rating,"Short and simple :One of the best fish and chips I had. No more. No less. Tartare sauce (home made) was good, fries and fish were perfectly cooked. And we had more than enough food for two people for the 14$95 option. I will definitely go back for more"
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The first time I tried this location, I was pretty smitten - at least with the quality and crispness of the main attraction 'the fish' in the fish n chips. This time not so much, the fish was undercooked.I'll say that on that level I would have given a 2 rating. However, several redeeming factors ensued or precluded the fish incident. For starters their clam chowder isn't to bad at all. In fact it's about a 4 on it's own...OK good start - and those cute Oyster crackers (they have to count for at least a half star).The fries and tartar sauce were up to 'relative par', I especially like the crispy bits and pieces at the bottom of the basket, and the sauce flavourful enough to eat on its own.  Unfortunately, as I mentioned at the open - this trip the fish was well undercooked, glassy and somewhat clear - you know the look. Our server did have it changed (mentioning to the cooks to cook it more in the future - not just my order), however, the new order came back less cooked than I'd like, yet enough to eat and not bring up the previous layers of food already eaten. I was very surprised, though I guess even fish n chips can go a bit south from time to time. Perhaps, a third try???Note: The large order of fish (3 pieces) is enough to feed several mouths and fairly priced - if folks want to share."
/user_details?userid=mHW8RaOu3BCw8YMTnLKcVA,Steve K.,"Hudson, Canada",4 star rating,"Went on a Thursday evening and got a seat immediately. Decor is cool, older diner style but very pleasant. The menu is simple and reasonably priced with burgers and fish & chips as the main focus. I had fish & chips, it was above average, not the best in the world but very good. The fish wasn't oily, hard to do for deep fried. The fries are excellent. They have a limited beer menu which was a nice surprise.There is a big take out business in case you want to just grab something and go home to eat. Would go back."
/user_details?userid=yX0g0cSodyqpIzfa6teVKg,Sabrina P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Possibly one of the best fish and chip places I have ever been too. The fish is always fresh and Crispy,  the clam chowder is amazing and the fried calamari are addictive. Staff is super frendly too."
/user_details?userid=P21dpPSLnON-eotYRrRvHA,Tammy S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I finally tried Comptoir 21 after walking by at least a dozen times. The boyfriend and I ventured out on a rainy Thursday night since none of us felt like cooking. Our initial plan was to get take-out and eat at home. I don't know if it was the decor or the fact that it wasn't a busy night but the second we walked in we looked at each other and decided to eat at their counter. My man was dying to try and rate their fish 'n' chips since he's a self proclaimed aficionado.  We both ordered the big plate(3 pieces). I'm a lady with a hearty appetite and it was way too big for me. I had a whole piece of fish left and some fries. The fish: very crispy batter, extremely fresh and moist. They only have cod which is a bit of a downer. The chips: out of this world!!! The poutine also looked amazing. The homemade dipping sauce: I'm a purist and went with tartar. It wasn't bad but nothing special. I'll probably try something with more of a kick next time.The vinegar: I must admit I was pretty impressed with the spritzer system. Although it dispenses flavour uniformly, you have to go at it quite a bit if you want to taste the vinegar. The service: amicable and attentive, nothing bad to say. The price: very affordable!Overall I didn't give this place 5 stars because they only have one fish and they charge extra for a second dipping sauce($1) and extra lemon wedges($0.50). The portions are big and 1 lemon wedge + a tiny cup of sauce just ain't enough. I think I still prefer Brit & Chips but that might be due to the Flake Cadbury...not sure. For now, their business card,which a magnet, is on my fridge tempting me to go back whenever I don't feel like being the ideal housewife in the kitchen! :)"
/user_details?userid=yIFyaNq4oCLoYkY1Gi0XAw,Corey D.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,Great little resto on Wellington. You can tell that it's fresh cod and not frozen. The fish is so light and flaky that every time you poke with your fork it breaks in two. It's best to scoop with your fork rather than poking. Comes in 2 sizes. Small comes with 2 pieces of fish and large comes with 3 pieces. I chose the jalapeño sauce instead of the tartare sauce. It was not spicy at all and didn't add anything to the fish. If choose a different one next time. I had the salad as a side and it was delicious.  Friend had the poutine and said it was good. Even the coleslaw was great. Definitely worth going. Will be going back.
/user_details?userid=-4TQswLHOgC_HQWsJhlVsw,Riccardo F.,"LaSalle, Canada",5 star rating,I have been there twice & the good food & good service is consistent.I usually go there for the fish & chips but change the chips for a poutine... So good but I can`t indulge like this too often lol
/user_details?userid=zIOxNinC6ofIwwGjO9rUWg,David D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"What is there to say? They make great fish and chips with a very tasty tartare sauce and killer slaw. There should have been more of that slaw, my only gripe. Service was cordial, friendly and attentive. The place has a unique décor that tells you you'll be eating fish in some capacity. At 9pm in Verdun that palace was over 50% capacity. Families, old couples, young adults. Well definitely take the family there in the future. Nothing fishy going on, just good business. Loved it."

/user_details?userid=2iRyEolDQn1OSpyK6icJPQ,David W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I'm not the biggest fan of cod (it was remarkably hard to determine what kind of fish they had from their website/online) but the preparation and the fries were very good. Malt vinegar in a spray bottle is a brilliant idea.
/user_details?userid=F4xjKVePMIzRlfeImBQHsg,Rafael D.,"Gatineau, Canada",5 star rating,Great place. The all-dressed Burger 21 and the fish and chips are the best things on the menu. Amazing atmosphere. The only hiccup was the beer. There was no neck at all. The bartender said she was sorry and that it was her specialty. Everything else was amazing. One of the best diners I have ever been to.

The service is really above par as the servers are friendly and go out of their way to make sure that you're satisfied. I've eaten here at least 10 times and I've never been disappointed. The rustic beach side resort decor is also nice!"
/user_details?userid=BdC_LPk_-cypzEysmfk0WA,D C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If I had to write my review based on my first experience here, I would be giving them 1 star; But, the bad review would have been my fault and oh so very wrong!My first time trying this place was when I sent my hubby out to bring home some Fish n' Chips. This is not the best way to experience Comptoir 21! Take out becomes very greasy and not enjoyable.Thank goodness for my Fish n' Chip loving Mum. She wanted to give it a shot and because of her I completely changed my mind on this place. First of all, the staff is quite nice and the service is fast. There is always something fun coming from the speakers, and the environment is relaxed and fun.The fish is battered a la minute, and is cooked to sweet perfection! The home fries, and interestingly flavoured dipping sauces add to the tastiness; I prefer their Tartar sauce. The coleslaw is whatever, but because everything else is so perfect, you can let that slide. Everyone seated with me, thoroughly enjoyed their food; No matter what they ordered (fish, homemade veggie burger, calamari). I suggest that you try the fish before any of the other option, you will not be disappointed; Just take the time to sit and eat it there!"
/user_details?userid=m0_W4iHkNZddR0msFtXI4w,Winncie L.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Always quick service. The fried calamari is light and not greasy at all, perfect with the herb sauce; the fish and chips is of great quality. The tempura shrimp is so so though, the coating is too thick, not the Japanese style. I'll definitely keep coming back for the calamari and all their sauces."
/user_details?userid=KYV3TpJiJB2LGN9umfmsHg,Shirley D.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"my. gosh. Best, best, BEST fish and chips in the city. Their fish and chips are crispy on the outside, however when you plug your fork in it or take a bite, the fish texture inside is still soft and it falls apart. But when it falls apart it is not a bad thing I don't think because I think it means they fry it so well that it's not dried out or anything. It still retains that softness of like steamed fish or something. I really enjoyed this place and love their poutine! What I would like to try next is their clam chowder. Comptoir 21 is truly a fish and chips heaven because I've always had overly greasy and dry fish and chips. This one? Super amazing. If you are into this kind of food, really visit! I 100% recommend!"
/user_details?userid=0TJ01iwzVLXtr_EYcfqoWQ,Offer R.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,"Excellent place if you are walking down Wellington and feel like fish and chips with beer. We went on a bike ride on the first beautiful day of the year and ended up visiting a friend in Verdun. We already know the other Comptoir 21 locations at the Latine Quarter and the Mile-End - but I like this one best. We sat outside (for the first time this year!) and really relished the last light of the day. The waitress was nice and friendly, although she was a little swamped. Once she took our order, the food came pretty fast. While we all had beer, I was actually the only one having fish and chips. My girlfriend had the veggie poutine (they have vegetarian gravy that is not bad) and our friend had a cheeseburger with fries and salad. We all enjoyed our food and I was pleasantly surprised by how calm this street is (compared to busy main streets like saint Denis or Mont-Royal where it's not as nice to sit out in the street). I was also glad for the opportunity to sit outside because sitting inside on the bar makes it harder to have a conversation when more than two people are involved, plus there is a lot of oil in the air near the kitchen.  We went to pay inside and discovered they only accept debit and cash :( but overall this is a good place to have a good time!"

I had great expectations but unfortunately it fell a little flat. The service is cool and friendly. The set up is minimalistic but cute, and the clam chowder was perfect. However, the fish itself was very greasy and felt bland. Since fish and chips are their specialty, that was a bit of a disapointement.The serving is HUGE you can definitely go for the small portion. I will say the sauce tartare and the french fries were great. Maybe we'll be back in a few weeks to see if we had only hit a bad day."
/user_details?userid=LknZlzFAS6Fkbe69g5J1Zw,Kat C.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,"Cute little place. Wasn't busy when I was there but there were a few couples scattered around the u-shaped counter. Unique set up. Perfect for a quick bite. Service was fantastic. Our waitress was so friendly and caring. (Not the fake tip-hungry caring... The genuinely kind-person caring). Even other staff who weren't serving us were friendly and chatty with us. Making customers feel welcomed and appreciated is a rarity these days so when you find a place that does make you feel valued, you want to return again and again. After we paid, our waitress, after giving us our change, thanked us with a big smile, then walked away without scooping up her tip. She waited til we left before taking it. A very polite gesture which we both noticed and found endearing. The food. I'm rating it 4/5 cause there's only one type of fish and my friend said while it was good, the texture isn't as ideal for fish and chips as some other types. It falls apart instead of retaining its shape and the breading falls off. Not a big deal for me at all. We still inhaled our fish with the tasty tartar sauce. His chowder could have been a bit warmer but he still enjoyed. Poutine. Vegetarian, they say. Huge bonus! And I don't know if it was the cruelty-free aspect that made me love it so much, but it was one of, if not the best poutine I've ever had. I would return just for that. Even those poutine-specialty places aren't as good. All in all a solid choice for a quick, casual meal at a place you kinda wish you could hug."

Honestly, we are quite disappointed. The batter on the fish & chips was way too oily for us, we had trouble keeping it down. However, the cole slaw, sauce, poutine and fries are great. The waiter was super chill. Even though the place was crowded, he kept a smile and always made sure we were ok."
