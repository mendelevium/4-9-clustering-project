We are from Toronto and don't know of any Romanian restaurants there...so we were so happy to find something during our stay in Montreal. We had the meatball vegetable soup to start, and that came accompanied with a basket of fresh warm bread and butter. So good! Then we tried three different plates: the sarmale with mamaliga (cabbage rolls with polenta), the mici with fries (ground meat rolls with freshly cut and fried potato strips), and the chicken schnitzel with mashed potatoes. Did I mention that the food was so good? We were so full but made space for the grand finale of desserts: the clatite (crepes with your choice of nutella or jam - we chose one of each) and the pananasi, which are like donuts with a miniball of fried dough with sour cream and jam. The portions were generous and the price was very reasonable too! We're looking forward to returning next time we're in Montreal!"
