Includes a wide variety of cocktail options as well as over 20 beers on tap. Service was very friendly and prices relatively reasonable look for the area especially given the quality of the food which is a tapas Style. We ordered the beets, brussel sprouts and foie gras which were all excellent. Â Solid option for before or after a bell center event."
