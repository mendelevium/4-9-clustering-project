Small local restaurant, takeout was a breeze and my order was ready in just 10 min. The owners are also really friendly.We ordered chicken breast, which came with a salad and fries as well as a chicken salad. Portions was good and every delicious! Their chicken was grilled and spiced perfectly!! Will certainly order again!"
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Dropped in for a quick dinner here after being in the area and were quickly seated at the bar. Seeing the positive reviews and the full restaurant within 30 minutes of their opening, I had very high hopes for Bocado.We ordered two glasses of Portuguese wine, the cod fritters, the chicken combo plate and the half chicken. It was fun sitting at the bar and watching the chefs do their thing and prepare our plates so that's definitely a pro. Within 10-15 minutes we had our cod fritters and they were pretty underwhelming to be honest. It almost tasted like deep fried mashed potatoes with a tiny touch of fish but nothing really special. Our mains followed quickly after and we were pretty disappointed by the anorexic chicken on our plates. Bocado has somehow managed to find the skinniest birds I've ever seen and their flavor wasn't even that great. The mains were pretty  normal - nothing amazing and nothing horrible (although honorable mention goes out to the delicious side salad and the hot sauce provided). Added to this, the hefty price tag of $85 before tax/tip was pretty disappointing given that the food wasn't all that great (we pretty much filled up on salad and fries). Won't be back and don't really recommend - tons of better Portuguese places in the city despite the friendly service!"

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I came here with my family. The restaurant has a saloon type feel to it which was cool. We shared the grilled octopus and cod fritters. It was ok. I've definitely had better cod fritters and grilled octopus. I enjoyed the mayo that the cod fritters came with. For mains, my boyfriend and I shared the chicken plate and the poutine. The poutine had chorizo and pulled pork. Both the poutine and chicken were good especially with the spicy sauce ! It makes everything taste better! My step mom had the fish. It had a lot of bones in it but she enjoyed it. It was a huge plate and the grilled veggies were supposedly good. We were all pretty full but we still got one nata each for dessert. Ma poule mouillée is better but if you don't want to wait an hour in line and you are on the south shore this restaurant is A-ok!!"

/user_details?userid=yIFyaNq4oCLoYkY1Gi0XAw,Corey D.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"Tried a bunch of entrées (octopus, garlic shrimp, sardine and calamari). The octopus was grilled, drizzled with olive oil with a home made salsa. Very simple and delicious. The shrimps were also very good and large. The calamari were ok, nothing exceptional. I tried the sardine (1st time ever biting into a sardine) and it wasn't my thing. Fish flavour too strong and lots of little bones. My partner says just chew and swallow but I couldn't. He said it was very good. Daughter had the club which had chorizo in it. Her fries were so good we ordered another helping.  cocktails were delicious and priced reasonably at $10.  Overall great little restaurant with friendly service I'll be back!"
/user_details?userid=tB-6EXsmpR8Q0RHYvEGjqg,Barbara D.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,"Bocado Grill was a spur of the moment lunch choice while traveling through Montreal. This is a small Portuguese grill with authentic, fresh, delicious food. I would have tried everything if I could, the food and menu, while unfamiliar to me, were explained by the owner, who let us come by for a quick lunch before the Eurocup finals game, Portugal vs. France. (Go, Portugal!) during which he had a large party of fans coming for a meal and to cheer on their team. (Go! Portugal!) Highly recommended!PS, Entrees are equivalent to tapas or appetizers. Full dinners were also on the menu."

/user_details?userid=6aWDAw37z6zgfw-f6HXFnA,Matt B.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"New place that has really picked up over the passed 1.5 years.I think there's seating for about 25 people max. It's a very tiny place, but well dispersed seating.Another neat thing is they do delivery, so if you like their food they can bring it to your place.All off the cooking is done directly before your eyes. If you are like myself you enjoy the show.The menu is on a chalkboard in lovely colors and meals and daily specials vary. The pricing of the menu is approx 10$ for an appetizer and 20-30$ for a main course.The food is all excellent. Good spices and well cooked. A great snack is their large fries and sauce for 6.90$ tax in. If only for those: I'd say stop by.The only thing is the price versus what you're buying doesn't feel right at times. Now, a poutine is 18$+tax (even at places that have 60$ mains that would feel pricey).Service is quick, attentive and bilingual (or better ;))"
/user_details?userid=LGuqeCJMZnxO-C8h8RnoSw,Frank N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Excellent Chicken a la portuguese. Cosy warm ambiance and nice lighting. Watch out for alcohol prices though, they are not shown anywhere and when we asked for a wine menu the owner asked us to ""try something""... it was a very plain douro, half a glass each and when the bill came ....OUCH ! $17 per Glass, Clearly we were duped. Food is good (well the chicken is), they have a blackboard with meal of the day and we were disappointed with that, chicken is what they do best. Above all I  suggest, asking for Prices on anything not on the menu. Poulet Excellent, ambiance cosy mais faites attention aux prix du vin qui n'est pas affiche. On a eu une surprise au moment de la facture de constater que notre verre de vin (mal rempli) coutais plus que la nourriture au complet."
/user_details?userid=6PKxQ07QMnzqzuoi8pEWbg,N S.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"We had the take-out family special. A whole chicken with spicy mayo, a huge platter of delicious fries and a huge platter of salad. The salad was super fresh with a tasty vinaigrette and the fried capers  in the salad was a real winner. All for $30 which I thought was quite reasonable."
/user_details?userid=KnN20CWPzPt97LlIzMCcvQ,Rick S.,"Saint-Lambert, Canada",5 star rating,My wife and I have been here a few times now and have never been disappointed. The staff is very friendly and ready to explain menu items. I thought their take on the club sandwich was very innovative and tasty and very filling.
/user_details?userid=Z_kYpKsgTyiQ1RKXoktvqA,Catherine G.,"Greenfield Park, Canada",5 star rating,"I went there recently (july 2014) and I must say the food is delicious! It is a very small restaurant but the staff is engaged and happy to serve their customers. They are very welcoming and were ready to answer any questions we had, service was fast and they had a very simple menu which I think is great. It is a great place that has a cozy and stylish feel to it, we will definitely go again!"
/user_details?userid=wEiqkBpVA96nFU71givB3A,Richard B.,"Hendersonville, NC",5 star rating,"Oh my gosh, this place has great food!We started with the sardine appetizer: 2 whole Portuguese sardines on top of lovely grilled toast (crouton or crostini) with lemon, garlic and Portuguese olive oil.  Very yummy and different than you'd get from Italian sardines.  For main course, my wife had half a roasted chicken (smaller than typical chicken, but still too big for my wife especially after the sardine) with a fabulous sauce (piri piri?).  It was served with a fresh, lovely salad made with what was called frissee, but was like the best leaf lettuce, olives, pickled red onions, and fried capers (my wife hates capers but loved these).  Additionally, there were transcendent, well-browned french fries with a lovely house made mayonnaise.  We were offered a spicier piri piri (?) sauce which was yummy.I had the lamb chops on vegetables.  I'm not always a big fan of veggies, but loved these even more than the excellently cooked and spiced lamb. There was bitter notes from broccoli rabe, swish notes from carrots or some other root vegetables, petite white potatoes, and green beans sauteed to perfection and well browned.We took home home pastelles natas for dessert: little custard filled pastries.  I was going to give the place 5 stars even if these were not good, but they were great.  The atmosphere is casual bistro with a big board containing all the menu items on the wall.  The owner was lovely, friendly, and very helpful.Yeah, I liked it!"
