/user_details?userid=7PTwhPEM7VWclYIS_1dSiw,Jéssica C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Really great spot for lunch! I stopped by for a quick out of the office lunch and I really liked their soup, sandwich and dessert combo! The day I went I got the broccoli soup and the reinvented hawaian pizza sandwich. The sandwich was pretty good, it actually tasted like pizza to be honest hehehe. I'm only giving it a 4 star because the food was good but not GREAT, but other than that the plce was clean, the staff was friendly and we really enjoyed out lunch. I'm a big sucker for plces with huge windows and in the middle of the nasty winter it felt really good to have lunch there by the window and pretend we were ""outside""! The dessert is actually quite small, the day I went they had sugar apple pie and something with hazenut, which is what I got. I liked it, though! The soup was a bit tasteless but still good. Maybe a bit more seasoning would be good but thats just me!"
/user_details?userid=iVXISIgh-unsJz57-qOHTQ,Sheryl L.,"Candiac, Canada",3 star rating,"I kept passing by this place everyday while going to work and the images of macarons on the window always made me drool! I finally got the chance to pop in for a late lunch. I ordered the lunch box which was 16$. For a sandwich I choose the apple walnut prosciutto sandwich and it was absolutely delicious! The walnuts were caramelized, the sweetness from the apple countered the walnuts perfect with the saltiness of the prosciutto.  The sandwich had a good amount of prosciutto slices, apples slices and a handful of walnuts. Really made me think of fall!  The lunch box also came with 2 side salads one a regular salad with Wagyu sauce and another kale salad. Both salads weren't great I could have done without them.I also ordered a chocolate caramel mousse dessert (5$). It was way too sweet I could barely eat it.Overall, nice place for an afternoon coffee and pastry, good place for a sandwich a little pricey for what it is. But I would go again for their sandwiches and pastries."

Le Westin's wifi reaches this cafe and there's always plenty of open tables (read: not as popular for a reason).The food is okay. They sell different breakfast sandwiches and quiches. We ordered the quiche and breakfast sandwiches and nothing was amazing.However, if you need something quick, it's a fine choice."
/user_details?userid=mo2wsDKfkFxD6ExDdRVw5A,Mr. J.,"Hoboken, NJ",4 star rating,Cute little cafe with some light food items such as sandwiches and salads ( and cakes ). Nice place for a quick lunch or to do some remote work on the go
/user_details?userid=2gZrgKYdAx92XvEhpHhWzg,Bernadette D.,"Maple, Canada",4 star rating,"Popped in for late lunch on a rainy weekday in Montreal. I had the lunch special for $12+ which included a cup of soup, salad and panini. The ham, brie, mushroom panini was delicious! The squash soup was perfect for a rainy day as well. The following day my husband and i had breakfast and the grilled breakfast sandwich was good as well. Their prices are not cheap, a meal would cost around $15 with taxes but at least you get good food. It was located right by  the hotel we stayed in (Le Westin) so it was perfect.Update: We went here again on our last day in Montreal. After dining out for 3 days i take it back...their prices are way reasonable than most places around Old Montreal like Tommy or Oliver and Gourmando! For $15 you get soup, salad and an awesome sandwich! Definitely great value for your money!!"
/user_details?userid=HHNxYGvWyHBP-8kPQIWB1w,Brent M.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"EXCELLENT lunch spot. Short walk from Old Montreal, and away from the packed usual spots. Good coffee, a beer selection, and the service is second to none. But the stars of the show are the sandwiches. The smoked duck sandwich is my personal favorite, but the chicken and avocado isn't far behind."
/user_details?userid=0cHEkFahUqJiobK3vo8BbA,Andy B.,"Bethesda, MD",5 star rating,"As soon as you walk into Les Moulins La Fayette and that wonderful smell of their freshly made baked goods hits you, you know that you've found a great place to start your morning.This lovely patisserie and boulangerie located in Vieux-Montréal, on St.-Jacques, across from L'Hotel Montréal. For those of you staying at the Westin (as I was), take the elevator to the third floor, then follow the dots on the floor towards the St.-Jacques entrance to the hotel. (Believe me, based on my own experience, do yourself a favor and skip the hotel restaurant, as it can't come anywhere near the goodness and quality of Les Moulins La Fayette.)You'll have a nice array of breads and pastries to choose from, and during my four-night stay in Montréal, I visited LMLF four times - yes, it's that good. Their chocolatine (chocolate croissant) is amazing, light and flaky, still warm from the oven with the chocoate still slightly gooey, easily the best chocolate croissant I've ever had. Their croissant aux amandes (almond croissant) is almond goodness through-and-through, and it's so popular that one of their regulars waves at the staff through the windows each morning to make sure they save one for him before they all disappear!You can also opt for a more savory breakfast, which I did on my second visit, having a grilled ham, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich that was just right, made to order and, along with their dark roast coffee, made for a great breakfast. They also make an excellent latte, strong and smooth at the same time - my compliments to the barista!Their menu also includes sandwiches on their freshly baked bread, beautiful pastries, and a collection of chocolates, making me wish I had more time in Montréal to try out more of their creations. The café itself is quite comfortable, modern in styling, the perfect place to start your day with a fresh pastry, a really good cup of coffee, and the morning paper - exactly what you should do when you're staying in Vieux-Montréal.Most importantly, the folks who work here are absolutely wonderful. The delightful woman behind the counter and her son (the masterful barista) greeted me warmly each morning, taking care of me as if I was a guest in their home. I'm looking forward to visiting with them again during my next trip to ""la belle ville de Montréal""!"

/user_details?userid=eoLKx6NVgfUsqQ3LSr7_QA,John P.,"Roseville, CA",5 star rating,"This was our second visit to this eatery and we were delighted with our experience.The place is clean, the food was well presented and delicious.  Our first visit did not go too well, every place can have a bad day and we just happened to turn up at that time, but the management reached out to us when we brought it to their attention and we were not disappointed, this is the updated review. The selection of cakes, sweets and sandwiches is very tempting! Overall, well worth a visit to a place that really cares about its customers."
/user_details?userid=JPd9zh0_fJB530fp6EEz9w,Anna M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"I was lucky enough to go back to Montreal for work and could visit this bakery several times during my stay. Taghrid, whom I think is the owner, recognized me from the first time even though she has a lot of happy customers on a daily basis. This bakery is truly a hidden gem and the best place to start your day with a coffee and one of their delicious pastries or croissants. I cannot wait to be back!"
/user_details?userid=ZBQdV7nTNza71IMMwD6QDQ,Jeorge P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5 star rating,"UPDATED REVIEW:Came here for our second and 3rd visits and if I could give this place 10 stars I would... Very convenient and just a small walk down the street from Hôtel le St. James.Found out it is operated by a mother and son team. Pride of ownership is all around. Tried their chicken barley and broccoli soups--D E L I C I O U S! Ham, egg and cheese croissant for breakfast and of course their apple turnover and apricot danish--WOW!! We also tried their crab, dried cranberries and Dill sandwich along with their chicken, feta cheese and black olive sandwich. Very fresh, very tasty and all served with such care, warmth and love. One final word. During our stay, we dined at some 5 star establishments that didn't come close to the quality, taste, value and satisfaction served up by Les Moulins la Fayette. We truly enjoyed this place and will miss it terribly!"

/user_details?userid=t4YGU4l5yTsYWEsg1GvwvA,Behrooz Y.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been here 3-4 times since January. The place is spotless clean, very bright with large windows and tastefully decorated. I find the music to be a bit loud. Their bread and food are very fresh. Their sandwiches are decent and they always have a few salads and a couple of soups. Most recently, I tried the veggie sandwich, which was too salty. The broccoli salad was also soaked in the sauce. The soups are great, especially on a cold winter day. They have one or two water containers with mint, cucumber or lemon in them."
/user_details?userid=BFcBwoxpkKGUIeUzOU0rRA,Gary M.,"Brampton, Canada",2 star rating,"This was a terrible tasting sandwich. Not a reflection on the restaurant (least I don't think it is), it was just a terrible tasting sandwich. I'd likely try this again just choose a different sandwich."
/user_details?userid=ylpWc3hukBIHpGhqqboT5w,Maria A.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,OK. So Montreal does amazing Sunday brunch. Weekday brunch a little hard to come by. We ducked into one place that was close by but opted out because it looked like they only served pastries and no eggs or other proteins. Stumbled across this place.  Almost walked out but then the server/cashier said they had egg sanwiches and quiches.Went with the bacon and egg croissant.  The egg was pre-cooked with green and red pepper. Not too many to make it overpowering but you could taste them.  The whole sandwich was put together and then pressed.  It was good.Ordered a mochaccino which was just okay.Not a bad place to get a quick breakfast.  Servers are nice and it's clean.  But it's not Sunday brunch worthy.

Lovely employees here who saw we were struggling with the menu that was in French. He took the time to tell us what they offered in addition to what was in their bakery case. He also recommended their breakfast sandwich which was super delicious. Mine had fresh ham, cheese, beautiful ripe tomatoes, crisp Romain lettuce and a touch of mayonnaise. Very clean and an additional plus is the great music while you sip your coffee. Lastly, the gentleman behind the counter made some recommendations to us in regards to what we should tour in the area on this beautiful sunny day. Total package for me!"

Four days in Montreal, four visits to this shop. We sampled a number of pastries, which were all awesome, but kept returning to the almond croissants and Paris-brests. (Of course, if you long for an almond croissant all day and then show up shortly before closing, well, you will get to sample their also-delicious-but-not-as-awesome chocolate croissant instead. We were there early the following day!)My wife reports that her coffees were very good.If we return to Montreal, proximity to this bakery will be an important factor in our choice of lodgings."

/user_details?userid=dPMeNs2Nqzh6h8bCvnoJbA,Jennifer A.,"Silver Spring, MD",5 star rating,"This is a delicious breakfast and lunch spot! Went for breakfast and had a quiche and shared a almond croissant- everything is clearly freshly made. Both were perfect. Came back for lunch and had their lunch special: a panini, soup/salad, and a small dessert for $12.50 or so. The bread for the paninis are so unique- I had an almost black bread with roast beef, pickles and Brie. This sounds bananas... but it was incredible toasted. I had the carrot soup with leeks- really a perfect fall soup that was not super sweet. The pecan tarte for dessert was sweet, sticky, and the crust was flaky and fresh. They also have two flavored waters for free every day. This is a perfect place to visit while near the convention center or in vieux Montreal!"

Above average coffee and ok croissants. Expect an above the average deli croissant with slightly above the average ham and cheese.
