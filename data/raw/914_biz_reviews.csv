/user_details?userid=i8iLHaE8dFzkrRvl9QdytA,Gigi S.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"This is one of the very best Malaysian/Thai restaurant we ever had the pleasure to enjoy.  The food is authentic and they don't skimp on the necessary ingredients to make sure it represents exactly what the dish is suppose to be. We loved it so much, we returned again the following day with our son.  It is a simple restaurant but the flavor of the dishes are nothing simple. One must try the General Tao chicken dish. It is like nothing we've ever had before. Delicious and crispy, not the mush we often get at Chinese restaurants .  The owners are so friendly and eager to please.  The cook being from Malaysia will not offer a dish that is not the super best.  We are so happy to have discovered that gem. We hope they will be around for a very long time. It is a must."
