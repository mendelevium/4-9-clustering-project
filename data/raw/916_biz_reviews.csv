We got the bacon and sausage cheese boat as well as the poutine - both were great! My boyfriend and I ate half of our dishes and then swapped so that we could enjoy both. Best decision ever! The drinks were made very well and were a lot more chic than I anticipated they would be. My favorite was the Moscow mule - they let you pour the ginger beer yourself so you can make it as spicy as you want! We also got the Knight of St. Nevski, which had Russian soda and tasted like banana. The Sunset cocktail was grapefruity and was garnished with a little rose bud - cute!Oh and their donuts are Y U M."

Georgian food is amazing, incredible, mind-blowing - Nevski's food is uninspired and heated in the microwave. The Khachapuri is bland and not much more than a mozzarella pizza. The dumpling or equivalent to Khinkalis are basically stuffed pastas you could've bought at Costco. Staff was nice, but I can't figure out why you have to order at the bar? Anyway. Won't go back."
