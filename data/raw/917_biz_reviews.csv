/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a real old-school French brasserie that's been there forever with a vine-covered terrace during the summer months - they are reputed to have the best Eggs Benedict in Montreal, which I can't vouch for since I have never come here for brunch, but I have come here for late-night suppers. I can tell you that their French Onion Soup, Steak Tartare and Bavette steaks are very, very good and they have a decent wine list too.I came in last night with a buddy after attending a lecture on astral projection and both of us wanted something hearty and grounding after sitting through such an esoteric subject. Also it was -27 last night and we wanted comfort food too.Thankfully Cafe Cherrier doesn't close until 11pm so we were able to get our hot,gooey,cheesy French onion soups almost as soon as we ordered it. My steak tartare was super-filling and my friend said the pasta dish was excellent. The Pinot Noire was also quite good given that many by-the-glass wines are usually not that great.I don't have a problem coming back here."
/user_details?userid=xFEidN4H-HEvtY4iV81Lew,Leyla K.,"Elizabeth, NJ",5 star rating,My friends and I were visiting the area when we stumbled upon this cafe and decided to give it a try for breakfast and we were not disappointed! This was by far our favorite meal from our weekend in Montreal. Definitely opt to sit outside if the weather permits. They have a shaded area so you can enjoy the outdoors without the sun shining down on you. I got the crepe with maple syrup as well as a soy latte. Both were great. My boyfriend ordered the eggs Benedict which he absolutely LOVED. He said it was his favorite he's ever tried!
/user_details?userid=581NruH_Ns8_FH7jr9wLiQ,Howard B.,"Miami, FL",4 star rating,A classic cafe and a 4-star rating is the headline.  Cafe Cherrier is located in the Plateau section of Montreal.  I was in here a couple of weeks ago for a business lunch and I had a good meal and a positive experience.  Cafe Cherrier was easy to have a conversation in and was a good pick for a business meal.  I ordered the confit canard and it tasted just like in France.  I had a cream of squash soup before my meal and it was spot on.  The house merlot was tasty.  The service was better than average.  The atmosphere was perfect and exactly what you would expect at a cafe.  It looked like they had plenty of outdoor seating weather permitting.  I would be a regular if I lived or worked in the area.

We were recommended by a local friend and everything was perfect here! We got the coffee, OJ, hungry ones, egg Benedict, French onion soup & soup of the day. The bacon in hungry ones was super crispy and tasty. I feel I can eat it all day nonstop! The egg Benedict is very creamy and delicious. I also love the French onion soup, the soup and the burned cheese on the top were great combination. The soup of the day was broccoli cream soup. It was also tasty and smooth. The OJ was fresh squeezed. I don't understand why it's only 3.5 star on Yelp. Everything was so lovely here. I would def come back!PS. Reservation is high recommended since it's always packed here!"
/user_details?userid=pLgl-_PNKFx5t9GrJNShfw,Mike F.,"Saint Paul, MN",4 star rating,"This was a good restaurant in general.  I loved the shrimp tempura and the shrimp-and-guac side dish.   The steaks were good but not excellent.  I didn't pay much attention to that because I was so hot.The cafe is semi-open to the outside air and has no air conditioning.  It might've been fine if it was more open, because Montreal has the humidity of the bottom of an aquarium in the year 2500 when all the cities have gone underwater.  I drank the water very fast, and they were pretty vigilant about refilling, so I do give them credit there."
/user_details?userid=JZP3-PCYyuDiGAOHDwZgww,Mrs D.,"St. Michaels, MD",5 star rating,We loved this place.  The pasta dishes are wonderful and the salads delicious. The Osso Buco was spectacular.It offers Excellent value with good menu selections.Le cafe cherrier is a local spot that has been in business for years with a stellar reputation among food professionals.The dining rooms offer plenty of charm.  We dined on the outside patio overlooking the street.  It was very comfortable and feels like you could be in Paris.A must is to ask for Jacques P. as your server.We would return just to visit with him.  He loves his work and it shows.  His recommendations were excellent and our group laughed for hours!
/user_details?userid=ANhN4BTo_02fTKz1hgKuzQ,Donna C.,"Arlington, VA",5 star rating,"This is an old-style brasserie that won us with its vine-covered terrace: I took one look and made it a point to sit there during this MONTREAL visit. We got a cozy table outside and watched the regulars come in for lunch. From Aperol to Iles flottante, the food was well prepared and delicious. My husband had the carpaccio of golden beets and sausage that was exquisite, as was the tomato soup. We both had the spaghetti dish of the day. Even the espresso that we ordered with dessert was exceptional strong and not bitter. The waiters here are out of central casting, my husband joked. Wry and French(ish). We grew quite fond of them."

I enjoyed the duo choices of eggs benny, one with full tomatoes stuffed with ham and eggs and the other with salmon. Dishes came with a great side of baguette.The service was very friendly and the place was packed."
/user_details?userid=rS2VeDc28wMeLKju4rn_RQ,Shannon H.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I had probably one of my most upsetting experiences at Café Cherrier this afternoon and I'm extremely disappointed with how the situation was handled. I was sitting on the terrace enjoying the scenery and my food when a camerawoman (who came out from nowhere) started leaning over my table to ""get her shot"". She then aggressively yelled at me to get out of her way-it was loud and extremely rude. Without asking me if this was okay, or forewarning me that the camerawoman needed my table, my belongings and my meal were moved without consent to a table in the corner. My purse was left behind. I had notified servers that my purse was still sitting in the chair and I had to wait until it was returned to me.The manner that this occurred was abrupt, aggressive, and honestly shocking.I know the servers probably didn't have control over the woman who was filming, but how the situation was handled was extremely problematic. I received a very dismissive apology for the and my glass of wine was compensated. However, this brusque interaction ruined my dining experience. I did not appreciate being yelled at to move in front of a crowded restaurant by some strange woman with a camera. Moreover, if the staff had been aware of the shooting, I should have been forewarned beforehand that I would need to move, not aggressively jostled to a new place.  If I had been asked politely before this happened, I would have of course obliged. Oddly enough, I never even received an  explanation for the camerawoman in my space when I asked. I asked to speak to a manager about the situation, and was told that this was not possible.I think what makes the situation worse is I genuinely believe staff would have been more apologetic if I had not been a young woman Black woman dining alone. I will not be returning to this establishment"

We also ate at L'Express and in our opinion, this place is better. We had the duck confit and a steak dish that was brought still marinating in the sauce. The food was phenomenal and the waiter was a sweet and funny guy. The ambiance was gorgeous. Highly recommend!!"
/user_details?userid=WrHCEpls59Uu4XNXNaK7fw,Carol B.,"Ridgewood, Queens, NY",5 star rating,"Stumbled across this place while roaming around Montreal and I'm so glad that we did! It's an excellent choice for breakfast or brunch with lots of menu options (all really inexpensive and delicious). Most of the brunch items were under $10 CAD.I got two eggs over easy with baguette and bacon. It also came with some home fries and a nice big piece of tomato. Yum! Rus got the same but with sausage (the sausage was really good). Our bill came to only $20 CAD (including coffee).Service was friendly, food was served up pretty quickly, couldn't have stumbled upon a better place!"

The bread before the meal was good, but would have been better if it was brought to us wam. I had French onion soup and an omelette with herbs, cheese, spinach, and tomato. Both were lovely. My travel companion had the terrine and the sausage, and loved both. We split a delicious creme brulee for dessert. Would recommend this place for a good, filling meal."
/user_details?userid=WtIGQeRaGvg7reGCDNFtxQ,Melissa K.,"San Marino, CA",5 star rating,"I'd never been a particular fan of beets but we ordered the beet salad and it was so delicious! All of our food was wonderful and the ambiance was very nice. The entire set up was both classy, old style diner-esque, and had a nice old fashioned but modern vibe (just like the city). Chef has daily specials and things seemed to follow the seasons nicely (I believe the beets were either a seasonal offering or chef's choice)."

And I wasn't impressed at all by their coffee quality. Their breakfast doesn't look great neither... but the price is relatively fair for a continental style breakfast, around 8$ with tips."
/user_details?userid=EXdGJmwZqLLisxjWxj1g4Q,Sabrina C.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,We enjoyed brunch here - each of us got eggs Benedict and the 4 of us shared the French toast which was made well and already has syrup on it. Coming from NY I'm used to having a side of mixed greens with my eggs Benedict but it didn't come with it so we ordered a mixed green salad to share which improved the dish. Baguette already came buttered and we ordered a side of Brie cheese which was okay (nothing that special). Tried to get to other brunch spots but wait time was an hour and this place had no wait. Can't compare to other brunch spots in Canada but liked it.
/user_details?userid=ONPFBZ8dy_m1sEzytqP2fw,Beth P.,"Irvington, NY",4 star rating,"Very friendly cafe with mostly French speaking clientele and a lovely outdoor area on St. Denis. The food is fine, nothing fabulous but just fine.  We all ordered off the specials and the seafood was fresh. Staff was happy to speak to us in English.  We wanted a place where casual dresswould not be frowned upon and this wasthe ticket. The other recommended places were just too fancy."

Waiter was busy but friendly. He made us feel at home even though we know very little French. We ordered 1 item at a time and loved every one.
/user_details?userid=6F6hwMk-sv7k35OoTionyQ,Patrick M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Always love this place. The food and service go from good to decent. Its really about the history and feel - is the closest thing to a parisian cafe. Get a carafe of wine and a warm goat cheese salad and you are truly in the spirit of France. Always sit outside weather permitting!
/user_details?userid=cqgjW23FJyu5kFlRDN1CpQ,Rawan K.,"Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,"Alright, so I'm giving Cafe Cherrier 2 stars because it is inconsistent. For breakfast, sure, it knows its stuff and rarely disappoints. However, I came here for drinks and dinner recently, and wow... I was SO disappointed. I think the only aspect of the night that got me through it, and was remotely respectable, was the wine. I, as well as a few others, ordered the bavette, which sounded amazing at the time, but once we received it, ALL of our meat was way overcooked. Meat like that is way too tender to be overdone, and we all ordered it either rare or medium, in turn we all received medium-well and well done. It was the most chewy and stiff meat I have ever eaten. The only thing tolerable on that plate was the fries --another aspect saving this rating from being a 1-star.Meh. I've experienced WAY better (sorrynotsorry)."

We ended up in the Café Cherrier. Outside and inside it looks really nice. It actually looks like a typical french bistro.Our intention was to simply take a warm beverage in order to warm up and after leave to meet my father for lunch. When we explained we wanted only a tee, the waitress was really annoyed. She told us ""you know for drinks you need to go at the bar but unfortunately all spots are reserved"" and she added ""it's almost lunch time and a lot of people are coming here"" so in big she was trying to get rid of us since we were planning to order just drinks. I replied to the ""lady"" that we had mentioned it when entering and her colleague still let us in. Then the ""lady"" said alright. So at the end she served us what we asked. After our tee, we left and the restaurant was still half empty and the bar ""reserved for drink"" as well. So yes this 1 star is only due to the bad service we had not for the drinks nor for the restaurant it self."

/user_details?userid=ol6v1oKA62i-eBrO2UbVZg,Maria V.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"A disappointment!  Upon ordering my croque monsieur, I was terribly surprised how poorly it was made. It lacked freshness, taste, and quality. The authentic croque monsieur has bechamel sauce, good quality cheese and ham. Mine was cold, rubbery and flavourless cheese, stale baguette and served cold with midocre fries. When politely approaching a waitress expressing my negative opinion on the sandwich.. her response was ""The issue is that you don't like it, not a problem of the sandwich"" I was amazed by her lack of professional people skills and how rude she was. Soon after I was offered by another waitress to order another dish. Which I I did. I requested the quiche Lorraine with fries. Luckily it was a bit more pleasing to my belly and palette. Fortunately, the raspberry tart I have ordered was outstanding! A lovely balance of sweet and tart with a generous amount of fresh raspberries. All this to say, the service was poor, the main dishes lacked authentic French taste and freshness. I will be seeking another place when craving French cuisine."

Cafe Cherrier has a beautiful patio that wraps around the store and is nearly covered up by the abundance of plants and flowers which make it a great place to sit for brunch.Our brunch was not too expensive (appx $10-14 / person) and the food was pretty good! I can personally attest for the smoked salmon crepe, the amount of cheese and the holandaise sauce with the salmon made it reaallly tasty. They have freshly squeezed juices which was a plus and their service was A+."
/user_details?userid=EDoFRBEo3hxI_SUQY2za-Q,Jim D.,"East Orange, NJ",4 star rating,"Had a great meal as we walked around Montreal, we were lucky to find this French gem.  I had Toulouse sausage, which is a mix of meats, pork, beef and lamb? My date had a nice cut of steak, that was very tasty.  both meals came with fries.  I had a few of the local beers, a wheat beer, that was very good and cold, a welcome relief after flying from sydney to Vancouver then Montreal.  The service was excellent.  The restaurant has an outdoor seating area that looked nice, but was to chilly to sit outside."
/user_details?userid=WlG4STWEe1dgSWBsrOzLxg,Michelle Y.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Very disappointing experience. It looks like a nice cafe with a terrasse.  But it was horrible. Here's why: 1. We were asked to move after sitting down outside  for 15 min  because the hostess didn't bother to ask if we were eating or just having drinks. I don't even know why we had to move for eating, but we didn't want to be complicated so we agreed to move. 2. The waiter had no knowledge of his alcoholic menu. I ordered sangria and he said he didn't have sangria. Asked for an old fashion and he had no idea what I was talking about. Ordered a cosmopolitan and he asked if I wanted a vodka or gin martini. I was so confused over just a drink! 3. The only good part of my dinner was the appetizer. Tuna tar tar. No complaints there. Fish was fine. Nothing out of the norm, it was good. 4. We arrived at 5 ish and received our main dish at almost 630. We were unable to find our waiter several times. Appetizer dishes not cleared, my empty cosmo was only offered a refill at the end of my meal so I said no. And obviously couldn't find him for the bill and even when we did, he took so long I had to leave to get my car while my friend had to front my part for the bill. 5. Not only did my food take forever to come, it tasted horrible!  It was WAY too salty my brocolini with sausage. All I did was drink water after almost ever bite because we had to leave by 7 and if I returned it, we would have to wait another 45 min probably.   My friend's pork stuffed with blue cheese lacked blue cheese AND was over cooked. Was way too dry. This restaurant is worth one star but i will give them their one credit, their appetizer was par. Will I come back? Never"

The location is charming but the food however is OK. Looking like a french restaurant does not always mean that food will be out of this world. I have had both breakfast and dinner at Cafe Cherrier and I am always left with the feeling; ""is it just me or could the food be better?"". I would take my friends for an evening drink at the bar to experience the ambiance but otherwise I am not rushing back."

/user_details?userid=-ibb_cZiaht_DjkIqDUF_Q,Jeff Z.,"Saint Louis, MO",5 star rating,It is our last day in Montreal and we were looking for one last lunch to close out our wonderful trip. We stumbled to Cafe Cherrier and were happy as soon as we stepped in. It was hustling and bustling with a local crowd including some business lunches. Was really interesting to see and observe. Really nice French food lunch. I had the French onion soup which was excellent and a Duck Confit with frites and salad. The salad was fresh and had a light vinaigrette. The duck was cooked close to perfect. Bread was super tasty and wine was light but flavorful.

With a great wine list, and 4 or 5 beer options (as well as cocktails), this was the perfect place to grab a late afternoon snack and beverage. Also at our table was the cheese plate, and the frits. As cliche as it sounds,try the FRENCH fries, they're beyond delicious. Between that and my Stella, I was in heaven. (There is also a full dining menu, reasonably priced)Cafe Cherrier was a delight to dine at. Great service, charming atmosphere, delicious food, and blocks away from other restaurants, shopping, and anything else you might be looking for.

/user_details?userid=TToYU8iVI_NtlW47n3HKVw,Isabelle L.,"Wheeling, IL",3 star rating,"We ended up at cafe Cherrier for a late lunch (2 PM) on a Tuesday afternoon and to our surprise the place was packed. We took it as a sure sign of good food and value.At first glance cafe Cherrier looks like a typical French bistro like the ones you would find in any French centre ville. Indeed this is exactly what the place delivers but with an emphasis on higher tier dishes if you wish to go that route.After looking at the menu we settled on the table d'hote offerings (prix fixe for lunch with includes an appetizer, an entree and coffee or tea). The food was good but somehow we expected better or at least we expected to be wowed with every single dish and instead we had different appreciations depending on the dish. The vegetable soup was outstanding, the smoked trout salad in comparison was pale in flavor. The fish dish of the day and the steak frites were good but nothing to rave about, the desserts were outstanding.So yes I would be back to caffe Cherrier noting that the service was bilingual (a plus if you have non French speaking folks in your party) and the food was solid with a few really good dishes. Overall, a good bet when in Montreal for a real French bistro experience."

Dee-licious! ...And I am not an egg person.  The orange juice is freshly squeezed and the coffee is fabulous which is a big plus...just enough flavor but without the bitter aftertaste that goes with overroasted beans.  The portions are enough for a hearty breakfast with out being too much.  The decor is sleek diner and you can sit at the bar and eat if there isn't a table available...which is where it seems the locals eat.  The prices for breakfast don't break the bank and most come in under $10/plate.

The first time, at a late breakfast by the sidewalk, we ordered poached eggs with meat and a nice portion of fruit, and an omelette with a large cafe a lait.  Everything was well-prepared and the service was good.  The next time, for a late evening meal, we were joined by three friends from southern France, and sat in the second (quiet) dining room.  Our waiter was quite humorous, which we encouraged, and I think we all had a good time, juggling between cultures and languages.  The soups and salads were good.  We ordered one of the cheaper red wines to share, and it was quite good.  Our friend from Provence, who has been living in Montreal for a year, said this was the first time since he had arrived that he had tasted goat cheese that tasted like he was used to.  I found it strong for my Virginia, US taste, so I shared mine from my salad with him, LOL.  The fish soup and French onion soup and tomato soup of the day were all good.  The daily special pasta was the only entree we ordered, so we can't really judge the entrees.  All in all, I recommend this cafe highly, from our experience."

As other reviewers have mentioned it was WAY too difficult to get the server's attention for even the simple things like refilling the water glass and getting the check. My boyfriend ordered the flank steak and was never actually asked how he wanted it cooked, however after a substantial wait for the food he finally cut into the middle and it was totally raw! When we were finally able to flag down the server and show her the poorly cooked meat, she said that she had requested it be cooked ""medium,"" but agreed that it was quite raw. She simply apologized and then said that if we told her before she would have put it back on the grill, but it was too late which was only more infuriating since getting her attention was such a challenge. She then cleared his plate leaving the entire center portion of his steak uneaten (a $24 dish) and although no compensation was requested, none was offered either. My veal tortellini was nothing to rave about and the escargot appetizer was underwhelming. This place is expensive for the service and quality you are getting.  A short jaunt up the street and you have a number of other fabulous options like L'Express that is in the same price range, but far exceeds the experience at this cafe."

It's got a bit of an L.A. feel in that people are looking around at each other a lot.It's not uncommon for two grown men to go to lunch here and sit at a little table, order a bottle of wine, share it, eat, laugh, discuss. Maybe this is what people mean when they say Montreal is European. Cause you certainly wouldn't see that in States.I love sitting at the counter and I love brunch. This restaurant located just north of the Latin Quarter on Saint Denis is perfect for both. Food is consistently fresh and good. You can order one eggs Benedict instead of two if you aren't famished - I like that. A place to leisurely enjoy one of your weekend late mornings. I've sat at the counter deep in conversation until only an hour of daylight was left in the afternoon. Allonge, mimosa, fresh fruit in the middle of winter. Love, love, love it."

We sat outside on the lovely terrace.  I had the chicken liver salad, which was excellent, my husband had the croque monsieur, which was served opened faced.  He said it was very good,  I had a glass of the Quebecois Rose which was very nice.  The service was attentive and efficient.  It was a very nice restaurant, and especially on a sunny day if you enjoy outdoor dinning."
