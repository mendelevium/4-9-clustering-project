The food was pretty decent for its price. However, the chicken was very dry and the portion was a little bit small. There wasn't much avocado although we pay extra for it."
/user_details?userid=5pvqFOVS2wb_y81t7iE0Bw,Denise K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I am tough when critiquing, but I absolutely had to give this place 5 stars just because of the health - price ratio. This has got to be the healthiest fast food Tex-Mex place ever in all of Montreal!Everything is fresh and tasty, and just when it couldn't get any better, they tell you that the lettuce they use is organic lettuce!My favourite dish, only because I am on a perpetual diet are the lime and coriander tacos with toppings and in hard corn tortillas. They give you 3 of them for $8.45! Add a side of guacamole and corn chips for $4.50, and what more could you ask for. They are even affiliated with Uber Eats. Don't forget to taste their sour cream with lime and coriander sauce, one of the many choices available! Absolutely delicious and healthy!"

I like it, it's not authentic Mexican food but it serves a purpose. It's also very filling and relatively inexpensive. It can be a healthier option when you want something quickly but don't want typical fast food.  I like that they have a variety of toppings and sauces, with several hot ones if you like it really spicy. I especially enjoyed the pickled onions which made my burrito bowl a bit more interesting and zesty. It won't blow your socks off, but you don't always want to risk losing your shoes."

Everything is always fresh. They have lots of good options to fill up your burrito. I usually get the spicy chicken...nicely seasoned. The staff is always very friendly."
/user_details?userid=fEyWCNZCsq_IeyzD0iwG1g,Shoshana R.,"Cote-Saint-Luc, Canada",1 star rating,The service was awful. The guy walked away in the middle of me ordering and had to practically beg the rest of the staff to continue serving me. The food was absolutely terrible. I tried the beyond meat with tacos. It was not edible and the taco shell itself was stale and cold. When I told the guy behind the counter he didn't care. Waste of money and time and on top of it I'm still hungry because I couldn't eat it.

But I ordered 3 tacos and I only got 2. I paid for THREE tacos. Where did my other one go? So minus 2 stars for only getting me two tacos when I ordered three. And to conclude,always make sure you have THREE tacos if you order three:)"

/user_details?userid=lKRbcLWDQmOmhcMa3vMCMA,Emily F.,"Saint-Jérôme, Canada",4 star rating,"I enjoy this new Mexican resto on the corner of Cote-St.-Catherine & Cote-des-Neiges. It is really nice because it offers a healthy option. The toppings are fresh and you have a good choice of meats (beef, chicken/spicy chicken, fish fillets). I always order the regular burrito because I like it so much. Their sauces are super tasty (my fav is the sour cream w/ lime and coriander) and I like how they have a choice between brown or white rice. You make it as spicy or as mild as YOU want! Return worthy for sure!"

Their chicken quesadillas are so yummy and so is their tortilla salad. I have yet to try their tacos but I bet they're yummy. I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for Mexican or in a quick pinch and need something fast."
