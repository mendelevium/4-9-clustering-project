/user_details?userid=OLuLUedoI8b9C_7YrspOmg,Steve M.,"Cedarburg, WI",4 star rating,Cheval is in the top 10 to 20 steak houses in North America. The massive grill is memorable. 1 time there i dined alone at the var. 1 time there was with 2 guys. 1 time was a table for about 18. All great. I loved it.  Whatever you want from the fabulous waiters they will take care of. Go Bruins!
/user_details?userid=2OBiw7J5alFQF2Vs_AiNqA,Melissa G.,"Charleston, SC",4 star rating,"I will start by pointing out the obvious: This place is expensive. Definitely not something for a casual or budget meal. Having said that: the food is awesome! I went to queue de cheval for a work dinner and I really enjoyed It.  We were a big group (about 20 people) and we ordered family style, including a couple giant family sized wine bottle. We tried the oysters, steamed lobster, crab legs, tomahawk steak, Brussel sprouts, the larges meatiest shrimp  and three different types of dessert. Everything  was excellent and the service was impeccable. My wine glass was always full and a server was there at all time to anticipate my needs the reason for the  star: all the water that they serve is Fiji water which comes in plastic bottles. As someone who is trying to reduce plastic usage, I cringed every time the waiter opened a new bottle to refill my water glass. I am sure Montreal has good water, why waste the extra plastic ?? Why not switch to glass bottles if so inclined? Overall a great place to eat, specially if someone else is paying."

Now with the media revelations, you wonder what else remains concealed. Did they cut corners in terrible ways that I don't know? Maybe they didn't. My feelings: just don't do it. Or at least read more about this place on the world's largest search engine & then decide if you want to take the risk."
/user_details?userid=b1pp1dYNdwAKX3NL24sUyw,Derek W.,"Cambridge, MA",2 star rating,"The two stars is essentially for the service. I was in a party of 12 and the best man booked this steakhouse, this best man has been to probably almost every great steakhouse in America, but this isn't the united states, this is in fact Canada, north america if you will. The drinks, if you are going to use a smaller sized martini glass, then fill my fucking drink to the rim where all the volume is you cheap son of a bitches. This made me very upset. The Apps, only speaking for the wedge here, because we opted for no apps, no oysters, nothing. The wedge was meh, a $16 dollar wedge should never be meh, it should be YEAH. Too many chives smashed into the blue cheese, and I like chives, but not like that, leave my wedge alone. The Sides, I love mushrooms so when I see Chef Mushrooms on a menu I get very excited, we ordered 3 orders of these at $20 a whack, it was the most disappointing thing I have ever ordered they were essentially tasteless mushrooms sliced in 6 pieces laid out flat on a plate, they were the size of a quarter, you read that right. They should be ashamed of themselves, if I were the chef, I would be angry. The meat, bone-in rib eye, big surprise I know. They march out your choice all on a platter pre cooked, hey look,  these are your steaks, awesome. I don't care for any of this, you know what I do care about, ordering a medium rare steak and having it cooked basically medium, which meant the ends were well.....well. Also I realize we are in Montreal, but I didn't see anywhere on the menu that stated they are putting Montreal seasoning all over my fucking steak. This was it for me, I'll just leave the rest of this cooked meat on my plate in view for the waiter to ask me how was my steak? Guess what, never happened, they were very attentive to refill your water though, still water out of a bottle at $4 a pop. We had 7. Desserts, you guessed it, we opted out. They were nice enough to include a 23% tip in the bill, along with something called TPS and TVQ which I'll assume is some sort of tax to help with your free healthcare, correct me if I'm wrong? Actually don't I don't want know..... Oh and lastly, if you're going to be offended by photos that aren't classy, stay away from the Toilet, wash room, bathroom, restroom whatever the canadians are calling it, I'll post of a photo as well, of the owner on the toilet... Oh you think I'm kidding?!?!!?"

We had the Australian Waygu, USDA strip loin and the Alberta filet.Soooo amazing and each cut was so flavourful and tender. Couldn't say that one was better than the other, they were all excellent.Sides were a good size but there was nothing left over!It was an pricey meal but when entertaining clients it was impressive from the care and attention the staff showed to our clients as well it was a spectacular meal.I highly recommend this place if you want a truly fine steak in Montreal.I will be back."

My wife and I shared the porterhouse for two... honestly it was okay... we've had better steak elsewhere. The steak itself tasted really ""gamey"" for some reason. The sides were good. Might go back to try different cuts and write another review. I guess it's worth going if you've never been but don't have super high expectations. We got lured in because of the pics on their Instagram lol."

We had a great dinner and great laughs. The rooftop was sooooooo nice and the entire place was just beautiful. definitely some improvements are needed, the drinks were really horrible. The waiter asked to change them 20x but we refused. Steak was delicious and very different, sides were ehhhh so so. Overall, great dinner and great night with the friends."

/user_details?userid=XxBbmN0D74n1M_8Rc3RydA,Edward R.,"Monroe Township, NJ",2 star rating,"I've dined at the Queue several times but not in it's newest location and this being our 20'th anniversary we decided to give the new location a shot for dinner. I booked a week in advance and showed up on time for our reservation after forking over $15.00 for valet parking.""Reservation for Edward R? we have no reservation for Edward R, did you get a call from us confirming? I see a Edward R here but no reservation attached"".???????In all fairness they did find us a very nice table on the second floor in a smaller dining room away from the sensory overload and din of the main dining room and we were ushered there by one of the ""long of leg, short of skirt"" young attractive hostesses that populate the front desk.Right away you can't help but notice all the frantic movement going on around you, this is not classic seamless French service but rather steakhouse on Redbull as a quartet of servers,waiters and a suited Matre d' bustle around distractedly attending to two long tables of apparently very thirsty gentlemen having a night out.Then comes the ""Presentation"", the preview to dinner where the featured seafood,Steaks,Lamb and apps are presented and hard sold, we had already decided on the 30 day aged 32 ounce porterhouse for two so I signaled we had already made up our minds and off he went to sell another couple.Drinks next and after a claim that the standard Brut was unavailable by the glass a offer of a Rose with a slug of Cassis, a Figi still water and a generous bread basket.The apps of Big eye tuna and steak tatare were ample if in need of some bolder seasoning.The porterhouse arrived on its own cutting board with 2 halved grilled head of garlic, my side order of garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed asparagus {all 6 anorexic spears}. Sliced against the grain the cut displayed all the mouth watering sheen and char that comes with a fire grilled steak and it was exactly as ordered medium rare.First bite was as expected, tender with that little bit of crusty char and that all too familiar blue cheese funk but sadly little else...Where was the beef? where was that savory, tannic bite of a well aged steak? This porterhouse looked the part,felt the part,even smelt the part but where was the beef?...Maybe a little sea salt would help and help it did but  not nearly enough to justify this steak's cost. This sadly is no Luger or Wolfgang's quality meats.All the while the bustling and running through and fro continued but with 2 more players as the bartender and another junior waiter has joined the fray and a offer of dessert. A bowl of vanilla ice cream swimming in a double shot of espresso and a tall shot of Frangelico mixed in is pure genius and my creme brulee is not too shabby with it's fragile shell hiding a creamy smooth custard......aaand it's over,rather anti climatic and really not worth it at these prices, the star of the show failed to deliver, sides were at best just okay,service was frantic,venue was noisy and overdone bordering on gaudy and the constant upselling became tiresome. This is not the Queue de Cheval I remember so fondly and that saddens me as the Queue in it's newest iteration has become just another well orchestrated tourist trap.Oh... remember my reservation that was there but really not?. Well it included a order for a small pastry to be brought to our table to celebrate our 20'th anniversary.. Yeah that was lost also.Merci mon ami but never again........."
/user_details?userid=gBEwOWyeeJORWAA6e-NX9g,Michael L.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,The steaks while pricey are delicious and aged amazingly. Each steak comes with a roasted garlic that is melt in your mouth good.  Combine that with one of the best Caesar salad I have ever had and it makes an amazing meal.  The wine list is extensive but a little pricey. I do wish there were more Pinot Noir or heavier body Reds.  What adds to the experience is the staff was phenomenal
/user_details?userid=ndLWGY_v8JDK3YyRJDMziA,Jon D.,"Sag Harbor, NY",1 star rating,Overpriced and overly dramatic for what it is.   Loud disco music and fine dining do not mix.Sad.  It used to be decent but not anymore.C'est la vie...
/user_details?userid=sbKbpWwpdnc3u-VYD4wTKQ,Stella L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Over priced. This is what happened to me: we are party of 3 and came here for steak. We ordered our steak and asked the waiter to suggest something for appetizer. He said shrimp is good so we took the shrimp. The shrimp turned out to be a 132 dollar appetizer! This is so ridiculous. I will NEVER come here again. And advice for ppl who want to try it: never order something that's not on the menu. Ask for the price of their suggested food.

Food was ok  from NYC and used to big numbers  but the numbers here were obnoxious. 4 TINY SLICES OF CARPACCIO AND A HAND FULL OF ARUGULA. 25$ GREEK SALAD 25$ ALSO OBNOXIOUS. ITS TOMATOES AND CUCUMBERS FOR GODS SAKE.  STEAK NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT Coming here for 17 years. Come on Pete  Get back in the game. We loved this place.  What happened?

/user_details?userid=5cG2RHuqPO5c25UWnnIZ7A,Michael S.,"Hampstead, Canada",1 star rating,"The food was relatively good and the waiters were excellent. The experience, however, was tainted by watching the owner abuse and yell at the kitchen staff. He was slamming plates, swearing and plainly abusing his employees. It was one of the most pathetic displays of blatant abuse by a small and wretched man that I have ever seen. It left a horrible taste in my mouth and spoiled the hard work of the employees."
/user_details?userid=JrTsaMac8BnAkLuJ3MfGzA,Aileen L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"ATMOSPHERE: It's a very fancily decorated place. A little bit small but still lovely on the inside. Most walls have nice paintings on them, giving them a bit of that classic ""antique"" feel.FOOD: Overall, the presentation was very nice. The food itself was good. The steaks are tender and the fish has pretty good flavor to it. Unfortunately, for the price I paid, nothing really made me fall out of my chair but it was still quite tasty. It was a nice experience to have but I don't think I'd come back here again (for my wallet's sake and there are better things to eat out there).PRICE: It's definitely quite expensive. You'd only come here on special occasions, or if you're fancy enough, a business lunch. SERVICE: Service was pretty good. I expected much better from a high-end restaurant if I'm being completely honest."
/user_details?userid=YQnHY3a0ijBG93fVcv3SDw,Ryan C.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"To start with the conclusion, definitely come here if you want to try very exotic, expensive, amazing steaks (and they have all the normal top-flight steakhouse options too). It's not very often to see a menu with such a variety of extremely premium cuts, so steak lovers, prepare yourselves.I went with the Japanese A5 Wagyu 8oz rib cut. As you would expect, it was melt in your mouth delicious. A bit of nutty flavor from the dry aging added to the amaze-factor. Only a few things kept me from almost not going to a 5 Star on the review, one of them being my steak arrived a bit cooled down, probably because my fellow diners ordered cuts that needed more cook time, so I had a feeling it probably rested longer than usual.Our group had a fresh seafood tower, poutine (amazing!!), lobster mac'n cheese, creamed spinach, mushrooms, etc. everything was delicious.I'd like to thank the staff for doing their best to accommodate our group. We decided to sit outside (it was a bit cool, so they didn't have it open or staffed), but they teamed up and made us comfortable. Had they been fully staffed, I'm sure things would've progressed a bit faster. But I certainly won't ding the review because everyone was very nice and helpful while also covering their inside tables. The ambiance inside looked nice, but we had a lot of fun outside. And we were a bit loud anyway, so it worked out for everyone. I can't wait to visit again."
/user_details?userid=wMDiDk6GRMd7c1rZ4gLQpg,Tony M.,"Stoneham, MA",1 star rating,"Terrible service and poorly prepared steaks. We waited 2 hours for the food to be served and was cold when it arrived. After my friend's steak was sent back twice, it was still raw and he couldn't even eat it. The waiter even spilled a bloody steak on my buddy. After the cold food and slow service, the only thing they would do for us was take the unacceptable steak off the bill and not charge us for a side of potatoes that they never even served. Unacceptable"
/user_details?userid=e_jRFyF1nRRzP5h_5Nzziw,Ruth B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The reviews here are a bit negative but I went with an open mind. In my humble opinion, I think most people end up deceive because they had really high expectations and it comes with a really hefty price tag. We had the tuna tartar as an appetizer. I really enjoyed it, especially the ""spicy"" sauce. So I will definitely recommend it. Then we shared a nice steak (20 oz Lou's cut: bone-in-rib) And drunken beef which is a 8 oz of filet mignon marinated in Porto topped with goat cheese. If you don't like goat cheese do not order this plate. The steaks were good but not the best I have I have ever had. {insert Drake verse} We ordered our steaks medium rare and they were closer to medium. We had a side of lobster mash. I think I would have appreciated it more if the pieces of lobster were bigger. Everything was ok/good but I didn't fell off my chair. We didn't have desert because we were pretty full. I really appreciated the service though. I'm not sure I will be back but I'm happy I tried at least once."

/user_details?userid=ztgrRuhMQsrqnQw8XHhTVg,Arthur W.,"Henderson, NV",4 star rating,"Before coming I read many of the negative and positive reviews. Decided to try it anyway since it was close to our hotel and it was -11C with windchill. The short story: in my opinion, the nay sayers were wrong. Service was outstanding. They did NOT charge for the Fiji water at all - I checked the bill. The glass of wine they picked for me was $18 and a very reasonable Cabarnet Sauvignon.  The 60 day dry aged steak had to be cooked one degree more rare (I usually order it medium rare, and was advised by our waiter Johnny, when I asked  about this;  he told me the dry aging removes most of the blood and to order it rare). He was bang on the money on this one - outstanding steak - nice aged flavour, which is not for everyone. My wife's miso cod was sent back to the kitchen by the MANAGER because he did not like it's look and redone - my wife ate all of it - delicious. The only thing we didn't like was the lobster dumplings because it was way too spicy - when we asked about it - we were told that we could ask them to remove the Thai chili oil next time. Having eaten at more than 40 Las Vegas restaurants (many top end ones), I thought this held it's own. Not cheap folks, but quality seldom is. Put it this way, better than the steak I had at the famed Hawksmoor restaurant on Air St. in London (Piccadilly) where I was a week ago. Will definitely be back. Admittedly, I can afford their prices. Love other steak houses at Moishes, and Gibby's in Montreal, which probably offer better perceived value, but this was excellent nevertheless in my opinion."
/user_details?userid=YbnSeoO12v2r4_edcKNEAA,Allan F.,"Stamford, CT",1 star rating,"Over the years  I have been there several times. The old place was simply amazing to look at and the food and service were the very best.   Something has been lost here about the old place. The magic of a wonderful dining experience is gone.      It was actually a really  enjoyable and memorable place to go to nearly 20 years ago.   Now it seems like it has lost its soul.  Frankly it now  feels all about money and all about trying to squeeze you for every penny.   I am not pleased with my recent visit.       In the past I did not mind paying such inflated prices because I am an infrequent visitor to Montreal and my trips to this establishment were kind of like a personal treat.  Well I am sad to say that the treat part is no longer in existence.   I will need to look elsewhere to be pampered and have a stress free and excellent dining experience that I used to find here.  It is GONE.    As many of the other reviews have stated here on Yelp the feeling is a common one that this place is very over priced and it seems that more and more of the members here feel that the food quality and service has gone down hill from what it used to be.     I am sad to be reporting this news as it means that one more good memory from the past days has left and is no longer with us.I note that many of the reviews here are making the same comment that they liked the place better in the old location and that the experience is no longer what it was or worth the crazy prices they are charging.I have decided to take the high road here and I have removed much of what I originally had to say because I believe it is better to save my energy for giving praise to a place that gave me a good experience rather than trashing a place that really offended me and disappointed me.     I hope that my comments here will encourage the ownership to step up their game, stop taking people for granted and try and restore the old level of service and quality to which their reputation was built."
/user_details?userid=WEwFC8yAbaKCOtc9BmVvEA,Katerina B.,"Miami, FL",5 star rating,"WOW! We just arrived from one of the best meals any of us had ever had at a Steakhouse. I think that many of the negative reviews are left because of its high prices but when the food quality is that excellent, one must expect those high prices. Our server, Lambros, and the rest of the team really took our meal to the next level. To start, I had the Italian filet mignon tartar made with black truffle oil and Parmesan cheese (amazing with a slice of black truffle on top). We ordered 2 20oz Kobe steaks and a lobster tail for our table of 6. These were so wonderful and impressive that even the cooks were taking pictures of the steaks they had just cooked up for us. Every one of the sides we ordered were awesome, in order of my most favorite: Brussel sprouts, corn, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes. He also recommended a wonderful wine bottle that complemented our meal impeccably and especially the cheesecake dessert (unbelievably good!!). We're really hoping to make it back tomorrow before going back home. This might just be our new Montreal favorite."

As we arrived they took care of our coats and we were seated. The quality of service was perfect. We all ordered from their lunch menu, which is very affordable for the quality of service and food they serve (27$). I had their lobster bisque, traditional tartare with fries and their crème brûlée, everything was a-ma-zing. One person did complain about their food being greasy, she had an Italian tartare and didn't finish it. As a drink I had a half pint of beer which was also very affordable (6$). The plus of this visit was that we were taken for a tour of the restaurant, which is always interesting to me. I would definitely recommend this place for lunch for numerous reason, the top quality of their service, the quality of the product served, the particular attention they pay to their customers."

Also he messed up on our order which was pretty straight forward so had to wait for what we actually ordered.This caliber of restaurant you would think it would be top notch.

I wanted it because i always take sea urchin sashimi style at japanese restaurants. We were disappointed about this dish since there were loads of seaweed inside the shell, interwined between the meat, making it hard to eat, taste it on my tongue  and swallow it because I had to remove the seaweed at every single bite. No way, this was completely not what I used to like from Japanese cuisine. We wasted $29.00 + tax for this little creature!!! Other dishes included rack of lamb grilled on charcoal, prime rib steak au jus, grilled jumbo tiger shrimps with thai style sauce.

I was in for a business trip so the people I was visiting took 6 of us to the restaurant. We had a very nice server who explained everything to us. The majority of us ordered medium rare, one of us ordered medium well. Every single one of our steaks were cooked wrong. The three of us that ordered medium rare got steaks that were rare..... and the one who ordered medium well got well done. One of us ordered lobster and it was overdone too.The quality of the meat was really good, but the chefs need to learn to cook steaks. One of my coworkers spoke to the manager and he looked like he was telling us to get out and F off with his eyes. We were just giving honest feedback.To top it off, after we left we noticed they charged us for an extra bottle of wine.NEVER RETURNING HERE"

For the fact in Jack Astor's once they brought me lemon in hand!!2) Not clean bathroom for sure.3) Service. Pushy and sneaky!It is definitely not michelin star restaurant but good looking one if you come to impress someone not with food.Overall. Overpriced and not delicious for sure!"

The ones i wanted, i bought.  Those i didn't, i didn't.  He did this between discussions about his carnival days(seriously), american politics, curling, and even the premature passing of his father.  I also learned more than i ever thought possible about RWA beef!This place has an identity.  So do its products and its staff.  Danny, Gabrielle, Peter (and his reticent son) and even Majeed(!) made our evening. If you understand fine dining and appreciate the cost associate with such an experience, they will knock your socks off.

Went for a Sunday evening meal, based on a positive experience at their old restaurant, and it was mind blowing how bad it was:(1) For 'the best' steak in Montreal, it is average at best, at a very high price. (2) the wait staff are extremely invasive, our waiter was listening to our conversation all evening and would periodically jump into our conversation when he heard something that interested him. (3) The manager came to ask how our steak was when we started the meal. We told him average, it was chewy. Instead of correcting it, he just walked away. (4) after we ate our meal, the waiter cleared the table and asked how our food was. We said (again) average, it was chewy. The waiter responded ""well it sure looks like you enjoyed it"" (because the plate was almost clear). We said ""it was average, not bad. For the price, it should have been excellent"". (5) we ordered one steak to share between two people, based on the ounces we wanted (20 divided by 2 people). The waiter decided on his own to increase it to 30, without us knowing. The price was double ($130 in total). When we asked about it when the bill came, they did not correct it. So basically, we paid double the expected price (about $450 for 3 people + a vegetarian) for average steak and extremely rude wait staff. Montreal is known for its food scene, go to any other place, Joe Beef, Liverpool house, Maison Publique, etc etc etc and honestly, even the Keg!"

/user_details?userid=ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,Jando S.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"One of the Montreal's most well known steakhouses became the site of our most epic dinner during my friend's bachelor party weekend. In the midst of planning for the dinner, there was a tossup decision between this place and cross town rival Gibby's (yelp.ca/biz/gibbys-resta…). The deliberation ended with Queue de Cheval for one thing: amazing service. From the phone reservation to greeting us at the door to the end of the meal, they did one heck of a job in accommodating our party of 12 hungry men.From the outside into the lobby, it's easy to see how beautiful this restaurant really is. In true steakhouse fashion, there are various cuts of meat from all parts of the world on display, something a true meat connoisseur can surely appreciate. We were able to get a spot on the second floor facing the street and the restaurant was like many other upscale steakhouses: trendy decor, well dressed patrons and wait staff, a lively ambiance just buzzing with activity. Generally speaking, the food always takes precedence in any restaurant but in places like this, service is of the utmost importance. The wait staff was quick and handled everything with ease, we almost never had to ask for anything as water was filled quickly, bread was refilled automatically, and there was never any attitude. Our main waiter was sharp, humorous, and extremely knowledgeable about virtually every item on the menu and was able to make some killer recommendations for drinks and food. We decided to pass on their appetizers, a majority of which would sully our carnivorous appetite for the one thing we came for - steak. Almost all of us were sold on the 20oz Lou's Cut ($54), which is the place's most popular steak.Along with the steak we ordered multiple sides of creamed corn ($12), truffle and parmesan fries ($7), garlic mashed potatoes ($5), along with a heaping of steak sauces: veal and truffle reduction ($6), cognac peppercorn ($6), and a cabernet sauvignon demi glace ($6) and staring at us was a hell of a meal.Everything was fantastic. The creaminess of the garlic mash, coupled by the delicious sauteed garlic spinach was melt in your mouth good. There were multiple foodgasms galore over the Lou's Cut, a hearty Colorado imported hunk of steak heaven in it's medium rare glory, juicy and went great with everything. The steak sauces weren't even all that necessary, but once added, there was no going back. Every bite was enhanced, the flavors were so rich, it was just the perfect amount of food; life was suddenly perfect.   Along with the Australian red and whites we sipped throughout the night, including 4 orders every side and a Lou's cut, the price we paid (sans the bachelor of course) was a very reasonable $82 per person. The conversation was as excellent as the food which was stellar as the service. Steakhouses might feel a tad more expensive in Montreal, mainly due to the importing of all of the meat, but when in town, this is one of the best places for steak period.Here's a parting thought for everyone: yelp.ca/biz_photos/Ek4sV…"

The 2 male bartenders were excellent with their conversation and stories. They had a beautiful new female bartender in training and she was great conversation as well. Steaks were excellent but they had a ""head steak waiter"" who was constantly just trying to push the most expensive cuts. The prices on the website menu were lower than the prices on the real menu, which was kind of off-putting but nothing to ruin a night. We also partook in some of their selections from the raw bar.

The attention to detail in the way the wait staff brought anything to the table (glassware, silverware, or food), was not the same as what you would expect from a high end steakhouse.  The waiters even spilled steak blood all over my friend's shirt because they were serving the food from above our heads. (and the manager did not want to compensate us for that until we sent him the dry cleaning receipt).The steaks did not come out warm and most of them were cooked incorrectly (even after having sent them back to the kitchen).My friends and I left most of our steaks untouched and were extremely disappointed.

Namely the following: The restaurant was busy - seated right next to the open kitchen - the stress of being busy turned into chefs yelling at each other and swearing at each other which really didn't make for a pleasant experience.We got a bad steak - a companion got a bad steak, and so at the prices we were paying, we suggested she let the mgmt know. Their response was to get her a new steak and charge her for both. Appalling and cheap. The 'fresh' food - i didn't think much for the food. I had a 120z baseball filet. My filet was not even close to baseball shaped - it was more a flat sirloin. And the meat was not tender like a typical filet either. It felt like i had been served a sirloin but i didn't bother saying anything. Add to it, the steak was terribly burnt on the outside, with a sharp gas tasting char to it. And add to it, i ordered the U5 shrimp at the suggestion of the server, which came out with an apricot basil sauce of some sort - i wish i had been warned or informed of that prior because it was not good at all.Overall, i found the food bad, the service excellent, the ambience interesting but terrible thanks to the yelling chefs, and the management horrid.   At $280 per head, i would expect so much more. I left feeling like i had totally been ripped off the experience i was expecting. I will never go here and i suggest you don't either. If you're looking for a good steak in Montreal, go to Viex Port, Moishes or Joe Beef - but stay clear of this excuse of a restaurant."

/user_details?userid=51mKC4xSIfJnpXcHDMbrJw,Joshua J.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I've been really *not* looking forward to writing this review. I do not even know where to begin. Unless you're swiping your company card or coming here for a bachelor party, this place should be avoided. Long story short: This place has been coasting on its' reputation for so long that it has forgotten to focus on the most important thing: the people that come into your establishment. So, we had a show at the Bell Centre later in the evening. We came in immediately when the Lobster bar was supposed to open in order to make time for the show. First, upon arriving, we were made to wait since the owners or managers were downstairs and in a meeting. Not even offered a drink for the inconvenience, just told to wait. For over 20 minutes. After our reservation. Ok, that's fine - we'll take a look around. I dig some of the design elements, we checked out some of their events online, it's definitely a chauvinistic establishment full of pomp and arrogance. Doesn't reverberate with us, but we won't count that against them.We finally get downstairs and get seated. No prices on the menu. Ok. We explicitly asked about pricing and got the run around. Great. There's some people at the bar pounding drinks and swearing like sailors. Sweet. Bartender is audibly bitching about guests from the night before. Awesome. Manager yells at one of the bus boys. Amazing. After spending some time bragging about the importance and status of Queue de Cheval, our waiter finally took our order (but not after trying to up-sell the living shit out of us). I will say that he took some time to bring out cuts of meat and show us the value in the cuts offered by the restaurant. While it was a nice gesture, it was clear that the display was more of a rehearsed gimmick than a deliberate effort to answer our questions. We ordered the tasting menu and the food began to come out. While the presentation lacked inspiration, we were cautiously optimistic, since the two first courses were decent. Nothing mind-blowing, but decent (at the very least, not disappointing). First course: The shrimp in buerre blanc was pleasant; the bone marrow with brioche was well cooked, though underseasoned and the brioche's sweetness somewhat overpowered the flavour of the marrow. The gnocchi with braised meat and parm shavings was delicious, but extremely heavy after a few bites. Still, tasty.However, our cautious optimism was destroyed as soon as the main courses were brought out (a sampling of three cuts of differently aged meats). We were paying 200 bucks (after tax) just for food, and the cuts were completely overcooked, requiring you to literally chomp through the char to get to the dry, flat, hardened pucks of beef underneath. This is a fundamental fail for a place that prides itself on the quality of its meats. It was clear that the grill wasn't even properly prepared. The meat pieces were covered in an unidentifiable (slightly nauseating) layer grease of some sort - it felt a bit like they hadn't properly cleaned the grill, and had started cooking the meat while the grill was still heating, then left the meat to cook for too long. When desert came down, one of the components of the three-dessert sampler was just flat-out gross (though, to be fair, their chocolate lava cake was quite good). Long-story short, this place needs some TLC. Everything but certain elements of the decor and two or three elements of the meal was a let down. There is an overwhelmingly self-congratulatory air to this place - they clearly feel like they are doing the public a favor, and are excused from offering value in exchange for the (considerable) money spent in their establishment. We will never go back."

/user_details?userid=8NzvsPWMGU6X5erBqidcsA,Trevor D.,"Miami, FL",4 star rating,"Before visiting Montreal I looked up a bunch of restaurants to go to and this was one of them. I looked at reviews and it was pretty much 50/50. Some good reviews along with some bad but it didn't matter because I had to see if Canada's steakhouse plays second fiddle to the U.S. as it does with so many different things.The setup of the restaurant is nice, two floors, an open grill, artwork throughout the restaurant, cigar lounge, the works. Bread- The customary bread basket was brought to the table. I sampled but was not impressed at all. I had to tell the waiter to remove it from the table because I did not want to ruin my appetite.Appetizers- There is a good selection of seafood and meat apps. The shrimp looked bigger than those at Prime 112 in Miami and that's saying alot. My friends and I decided to share the angry lobster and short rib dumplings which was something you would expect to see at a Chinese restaurant and not a steakhouse. Nevertheless it was delicious. The rib to lobster to dumpling ratio was on point. The sauce it was dipped complemented the dish very well. Steak- The restaurant imports the beef from Nebraska and Colorado. One is grass fed and the other corn fed in case you wanted to know the difference. I decided to go with the Lou's Cut 20 oz bone in rib-eye. My friend wanted to order the lamb but I made a save like Patrick Roy and told him to get steak, I should of gotten a Conn Smythe award for that save. We both ordered it medium. I don't like to give such high praise after only trying something once but it was one of the best steaks I've ever eaten. The steak was cooked perfectly, outside to inside. Pretty in pink throughout like Molly Ringwald. My other friend ordered the 18 oz bone-in-filet. I would say 12 oz of that was bone. It tasted good but it's very disappointing that so much of it was bone. In all fairness they did show us at our table the steaks that they would be cooking for us. We should have shut that down when we saw it.Sides- Wide variety of starches and vegetables. The mac and cheese is listed as an appetizer but true to the game it was ordered as a side along with the lobster mash potatoes. But ranked very high in terms of as good as it gets. The portions were sufficient for 3 people and it complemented the steaks very nicely. Desserts- The usual suspects are on the menu: molten cake, creme brulee, cheesecake, etc. The waiter brings out the dessert tray to give you an idea of what they look like. We were all pretty full so we decided to share the cheesecake which was covered with chocolate on top. It was very rich and heavy but tasted good. If I had 20 minutes to wait for the molten to bake or if the waiter gave us a heads up on the baking time it most likely would have been ordered.Overall, I give the Q 4.5 stars and that's only after 1 visit. Steak, sides, and cost rival many of the top steakhouses in the U.S."

I know how hard it can be to please this group of executives, but Queue de Cheval, did just that. The only gripe I can think of is the seafood. The lobsters and tiger shrimp came out overcooked. Yes, I'm being picky, but this is the only way a high-caliber restaurant like this one improves. On my next trip to Montreal, I will definitely be back."

/user_details?userid=9z8M598mrpUu4T9nrm2Tlg,Sandra M.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,My husband and I were there Friday night and we were so disappointed. We sat downstairs in a very nice booth across the beautiful bar. The music was very good really put us in a celebrating mood. Then came the food and it was all downhill from there. His tuna tartar was very good my ceasar salad was terrible. Too much dressing and the lettuce was all the dark green outside leaves. Could not finish it for how bad it was. Then we both ordered the 20 ounce bone in rib eye medium rare. Waiter convinced me to season it with Montreal steak spice which I did not think a good steak would need but he insisted. They showed us 2 beautiful raw thick steak and said those were are steaks. Then when they came to our plate they looked totally different and were not thick anymore. They were over cooked more medium. When they asked us how it was we told them the truth and they tried to explain that the meat shrinks when it cooks. 20 ounce steak should still be thick after it cooks. Then the manager came and asked the same question we gave him the same answer. His solution was to bring us a piece of garlic butter to spread over it to give it more flavour. So their meat is so bad that it needs Montreal steak spice and garlic butter to try to make it taste good. Even then we could not eat our $55. Each steak. They did not compensate or apologize for any of it. The wine is overpriced. $20 for a glass of Chablis. Paid $55 for the bottle at la Societe. I guess our expectations were too high.

My Loup de mare was perfection. The aged beef my family had was ok. Not my thing. Very nice waiters. A little fussy for my taste. Go but prepare to spend some money.
/user_details?userid=IDuD_Dxna8TA2sWFHENjWg,Marc S.,"Manhattan, NY",1 star rating,We made  an 8PM reservation 2 months ago with high expectations. When we sat down the waiter tried to upset us on everything.  He was very pushy with the expensive Kobe steaks.  They were out of 5 of the steaks on the menu including the aged Porterhouse.  I have never heard of a steakhouse being out of a porterhouse especially at 8PM on a Saturday evening. The quality of the steaks was very good but we unfortunately had to order whatever steaks that were in stock.  Some of the sides came late after we were finished with our entrees.  I would not return to this restaurant

A $250 price tag for an appetizer, two glasses of wine and two steaks with a side dish in a terrible atmosphere and an absolutely appalling display from the servers. When we sat down (at not a great table, upon deciding we wanted to be moved we realized that the layout of this restaurant is so poor there actually is no good table) we could barely hear ourselves over the music blasting from the overhead speakers. Upon asking, they turned the music down, only to have them turn it back up again about 20 minutes later. There was some sort of conflict happening amongst the service staff, one waiter kept shouting expletives and the managers were shuttling back and forth trying to solve the dispute. The entire experience was unpleasant and stressful. Avoid at all costs."

I actually came here for the QDC burger and the restaurant for their steaks.  I didn't realize it was the same place till after I had dinner here.  Then it all made sense... QDC... Queue de Cheval.First the burger.  I tried the spicy shrimp burger.  I loved the char on the bread (I think it's like a Focaccia?) , it gives it a great smokey flavor but the bread was a little too substantial / thick.  Overwhelms the meat a little bit.  They pile on the spicy shrimp onto the burger.  The shrimps alone were awesome.  Piled on the burger, not so much. Also with the sauce from the shrimp, the burger was dripping .   i would have probably like the normal burger more.  Now for the dinner. lobster carpaccio was okay, it just needed a much better sauce.  The side dishes were okay, my favorite was the mash potatoes.  The duck fat fries were okay, a little chewy.  The steak was cooked well... good char on the outside.  Perfectly medium rare on the inside... but something was just off about it.  Lacked flavor, a little dry.  The waiter raved about the quality of the meat... but I just found it lacking.  Ambience is okay. For a nice steak house, I find the TVs distracting.  music is blasting like we're in a club.  Wish they were tone down some of that stuff."

He called the owner to ask him what to do, and the owner who passed on the following message to our table: ""I don't care if they didn't like it, tell them to never come eat here again.""This restaurant is NO LONGER a top-tier steakhouse. What it is now is a hugely overpriced restaurant in a nightclub with sub-par food. Horrible."

If I knew that they moved to a temporary location (for 6 months) I never would have gone.The food was as I remembered it, adequate, nothing great. Here are the problems we encountered:1. Our waiter was bsing his way through the menu saying things like ""the tuna tartar is hand chopped"" what else would it be? Bought prepackaged? He made a comment on how we didnt order the popular french fries, received fries anyway, then realized that they gave fries for free to everyone. He was trying to run up the bill. I asked him why our tuna tartar appetizer was $38 and he said that ""since we were sharing it he took the liberty of making it a double portion so that everyone would be happy."" I'm serious, he really said that. Anyway, you get the picture with the waiter. The other servers were good.2. The restaurant's ""temporary"" space is shared with a nightclub. The main doors were constantly open (during 5 degree weather) making it extremely cold in the dining room. The bathrooms are graffiti filled and disgusting. As people were leaving around us the staff would take their tables away to prepare for the transition into a nightclub. They were literally moving furniture around right next to our table. Promoters were coming in and out of the dining room to discuss problems with the manager. We asked for our coats during dinner because our dates were freezing and no one got the hint. On our way out, the place was mobbed with teens waiting on line to enter the ""foam party"". 3. During dinner I received an email from opentable.com stating that the restaurant's management had cancelled my reservation. LoL4. Four people, $70 bottle of wine, $600. For that money you can eat at 3 Michelin star restaurants and Queue de Cheval in no way lives up to those.Try rib and reef instead."

/user_details?userid=1gQOls3XMJYdaAPKmxGlpA,Jimmy K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We went out to the Q last night, at it's temporary lodging of 1234 (pronounced twelve thirty-four), ready to eat slabs of beef and be manly men. Their tables were set up predominately outside the club, but we were seated at one of the two interior tables by a gorgeous hostess. We joked ""let the night begin!""Let me get all talk of the ""view"" out of the way. This place was swarming with beautiful ladies, of a variety of ages. They walked in from outside, or came down from the upstairs bar area, chatting and always smiling. Quite a sight for any hotblooded male, and certainly boosted the energy of the night for us.Our waiter came by after we had been seated, Jackie was his name, and gave us the regular steakhouse spiel. He showed off the cuts, and informed us on how the meats are aged and yadda yadda. I have to say, this guy proved to be the defining feature of the Q experience and we received some of the best service we've ever had from this guy. He informed us early on, ""I want you guys to feel at home here; This is your table. I'm gonna have guys buzzing around all night for whatever you want"", and he delivered. The atmosphere was relaxed, and we all felt comfortable sitting there. Wine and water was refilled as soon as the glass was nearing empty, and we were never rushed to move onto the next course.On Waiter Jackie's recommendation, we ordered several sides for table to share and most of us got Kansas bone-in steaks. I also ordered a salmon tartar and a prosciutto & burrata plate as an entree. I should mention that I'm not a big beef eater, and so I wasn't afraid to chow down on the alternatives. For sides we got the lobster and truffle mashed potatoes, garlic mashed potatoes, a mac & cheese, and garlic sauteed spinach.The tartar was great, and I would definitely recommend you try it. It was nice and bright pink, served with a little tiny dollop of cream and a sprinkle of roe. A very refreshing little dish to wake up your tongue. The prosciutto & burrata plate was also a great choice. I was wary at first, I had never had burrata before and, having had (amazing) homemade proscuitto, had little faith in restaurant cured meats. However, I was pleasantly surprised with it. The meat was all around nice, though cut a little thick I think, and the cheese had a nice taste and consistency. Our main courses arrived, and we all dug in, having smelt the food coming all the way from the kitchen. These are some big ass steaks. Like, really thick. And big. Taste-wise, they tasted like your average steaks, nothing special and no one at the table had any serious foodgasms over the meat. A warning: our chef seemed to be on a medium-rare streak, and cooked all the steaks as such, irrelevant of how they were requested. A little disappointing. I recommend getting a sauce or butter for the steak; One at the table ordered a Cajun butter, and he looked very pleased.As for the sides, the lobster mash was a little bit of a miss for me. The lobster element was actually chunks of lobster and so it took me 2 spoonfuls of the stuff to actually get any lobster taste, and my third and fourth was lacking in lobster as well. The mac & cheese was much better, just creamy enough and with a deliciously melty top layer of cheese. Several at the table commented that the cheese used was too strong; I didn't feel that was the case. I did not try the spinach or garlic mash.We skipped desert, and split the bill (note that they do not take debit cards but do have an ATM. It has a withdrawal limit of 100$, so plan accordingly.); It came to about 100-150$ per person, which is decent. Big portions + well known place = $$$$TL;DR Go for the entrees and the women, stay for the great service; get a sauce or butter for your steak, or skip the steak for something from the seafood menu (if you dare. Jackie won't be happy)."

I regret to say we had a horrible experience! Our experience turned sour when we started hearing some yelling. We weren't sure what was going on at first. It turned into some more extremely loud yelling/swearing. When we inquired from our waiter what was going on, he let us know that the person yelling was the owner. This was appalling and disturbing to know the 'owner' was doing this in front of all the customers currently dining in. Our waiter was whispering to us and trying to assure us things were okay- they clearly were not as the owner continued to belittle and yell at his waiters/cooks/employees. To one specifically employee- he called a 'crippled'. We got to taste the wedge salad and the fries- those were actually tasty, but unfortunately it was very hard to try and enjoy the food with the hostile atmosphere the owner was creating. We decided to get up in the middle of his continuous yelling/swearing towards his employees and asked for our check. We refused to wait for the rest of our meal. This was such a horrible experience- I was in tears in the restaurant. Why somebody thinks it's okay to belittle and treat others in such a manner is beyond me. Even if you're wealthy and powerful- it is NOT okay!!! I will add that they didn't charge us for the salad, fries and water even though we insisted on paying. I left there guilty that I didn't say anything to the owner about his behavior. I really hope our waiter didn't get stuck paying for our meal either. When we went to grab dessert later during the day, the owner of the establishment asked us if we had tried out the Queue de Cheval Steakhouse as he had recommended it for good food. We told him about our experience and he stated ""ohhh yeah, if the owner was there it was probably a bad experience- numerous people have experienced the same. I'm sorry and it's a shame because they do have good food"".  That's pretty disappointing that other business owners know this about this as well. I recommend the Owner take some anger management classes. If the employees messed up in some way with preparing or serving food- this is still NO way to address them and to do it in front of paying customers is NOT acceptable."

I asked the manager to try it to see how cold it is and he said he didn't disagree with me, then at the end of the night changed his stance and said they were hot. They ruined my friends shirt and pants by spilling the steak juice on him while carrying the plate over his head. They were proud that they did us a favor by removing the two sides that they never brought out. They did nothing else to remedy the situation. Claimed that they were watching each of us and we finished our steaks, which none of us did. We came to have a good meal, but unfortunately that was not the case.

/user_details?userid=SEMwFWY7duRtcMOoiCqYzg,Damian S.,"Long Beach, CA",1 star rating,"Quelle dommage... as the French would say.  Like watching a gorgeous souffle collapse before your eyes, this was the experience at Queue De Cheval.   Brace yourselves.A business partner in Montreal wanted to take some colleagues and me to dinner after a particularly successful event we co-sponsored.  He was quite proud to take us to this steakhouse proclaiming it to be the best steak in the city.  We walked in hungry and wide-eyed, the smell of the cigar bar pleasantly (really) entering the lobby/butcher shop in the front of the restaurant.The first thing I took note of was the meat case that sold filet mignon for $79/lb.  Outback steakhouse this is not.We were seated upstairs.  The restaurant seemed relatively empty for 9pm on a Friday night, so we got a very nice table by the front window overlooking the bronze horse statue (queue de cheval is French for The Horse's Tail after all).  The decor and ambiance is beautifully done.  Acres of rich woods.  'Bookcases' piled to the ceiling with wine bottles.  Artwork adorned the walls that befit the restaurant's name.  The centerpiece is a huge stainless steel funnel that encompasses the cast-iron grill on the main floor.  A spiral staircase encircles this chimney to get you to the dimly lit, warm and rustic second floor.Our pleasant waiter handed us our menus and then brought our first round of drinks.  He went on to explain the steaks on the menu like any other high end steakhouse.  They have corn fed beef from Colorado, grass fed beef from Nebraska and 'kobe' beef from Australia.  Kobe can only be from Japan, so I was a little suspicious.  He showed us several cuts of beef on a platter as well as what can only be described as a mermaid tail.  Jamaican lobster tails that were 2lbs on their own.  They also have Maine lobsters starting at 3.5lbs and going up to 6.  Price of entry for these?  $65/lb.Enjoying our beers, our garcon came back and took our orders.  The table ordered 3 Canadian filet mignons ($38) while I ordered a grass fed, bone on NY Strip ($53).  At the waiter's behest, we ordered 3 sides for the table - Asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms.  The sides were from $12 to $15 each.Standing on ceremony, Pablo brought us our uncooked steaks to look at, telling us they would be served to us in about 30 minutes.  Yep, they were steaks.  Thanks bro.Finally, our food arrived.  A steak on a plate, adorned with nothing but a split bulb of roasted garlic.  Nothing more.  Here is where things went horribly, horribly wrong (well, relatively - no one died).  I cut, nay, SAWED into my steak.  I was not entirely impressed with how difficult it was to get through this meat.  At first I thought it was overcooked, but it just turned out to be tough.  More shocking were when the sides arrived.  The asparagus plate held 8 small spears.  The garlic mashed came in a small cast-iron urn holding perhaps two small servings and lastly a cup of wet looking mushrooms.  I took my two allotted spears of asparagus and meager tablespoons of potatoes.  The asparagus was simply grilled.  TOO simply grilled.  Unseasoned, bland, and shockingly overcooked.  At $2 a spear, pretty ridiculous.  The potatoes were genuinely good.  The best thing on my plate.  And that's sad.  I didn't have any mushrooms as they just didn't appeal to me.  I continued to fight through my steak.  The flavor was fine having been cooked to my requested medium-rare.  However, It was woefully underseasoned and I added salt.  But overall, it was tough, gristly and disappointing.  If I were paying for the meal, I would have sent it back.  I probably would have sent this steak back at a diner.  I bit my tongue and smiled as I did not want to embarrass my host and his restaurant choice.We left after coffee and this morning, my colleagues and I had breakfast and discussed the previous night's meal.  I was glad to find I was not the only one wholly dissatisfied with their food.  I live in NY and have been to many a high end steak house there and elsewhere.  They're all better.  Hell, The Keg in Old Montreal was much better.  I can fire a much more mouth watering steak from Whole Foods in my own backyard.  Queue de Cheval seems to rest on pomp and circumstance, and sky high prices.  It lacked substance entirely.  I think some people will brainwash themselves to think they are eating amazing food just because the price is inflated.  They should rename it The Horse's Ass.  I've given them a single star.  A reasonably priced restaurant with the same quality food, I would have given two.  If you want to feel like a rock star, get a steak dinner at The Keg and then spend the money you would have squandered getting bottle service at one of the swank clubs nearby."

There was hardly enough for the 4of us! The sides used to be huge, not they are SMALL!!!!!!! I ordered the petite fillet, it came back rare...... when I ordered it medium rare. My husbands steak was also way under cooked ( he got the bone in fillet).They brought it back...... the outside tasted of propane, and the inside was still cold red. I didn't eat it.The maitre D treated me like I was crazy for not liking it.Their attitude was terrible. Our server felt badly and bought us some port wine to enjoy. Our desserts were nothing to write home about either.As I said earlier, this used to be a place we looked forward to going to! NEVER AGAIN!!!!I wouldn't advise going here.... it's not what it used to be!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The dinner cost about 500$ and we should have just thrown it out the window!"

Reminds me of the Morty's steakhouse in the states, the way they present the cuts of beef. The waiters always made me feel like royalty and the food is awesome.

/user_details?userid=gsPo9BpKVYO8jDhlJnNyRw,Jeremy C.,"Boston, MA",1 star rating,"Where do i begin?  Well, I had set up the reservation 2 months in advance for our group of 15.  Having read the reviews, I was really looking forward to this meal, as this was one of the main events of our trip.  Now it takes a lot for a steak house to really impress me, but it takes an equally bad experience for me to absolutely regret going....and this was that experience.  They were running a little behind when we arrived, so we had a cocktail at the bar.  Every 10 minutes or so, i would check in with the hostess, who perpetually informed me it would be 2 more minutes.  After 40 patient and polite minutes on my end, I finally demanded to speak to the manager.  He could not have cared less about our wait, was quite rude, and made it clear that he didn't have time to speak with me.  Within 10 minutes, they seated us in the 2nd private room upstairs.  It was a nice gesture, but thats where the pleasantness ended.  They had two different sized round tables, which totally ruined our ability to enjoy dinner as a group. We were told there would be bread waiting for us since we were all starving.  LIE.  It took 15 minutes for the waiter to get our drink orders.  Then a few minutes later, his assistant came by and asked us for a drinks, we told him that we'd already ordered our drinks, but would like to order some appetizers.  He simply walked away from us.  They then left us for about 25 minutes while they tended to the other private party.  Apparently we were not worth their time.After an hour, we finally received our appetizers, and soon after that, got our dinner.  The steaks were ok.  Whole Foods quality beef at best, and the char on them held the flavor of the fuel(gas??) that cooked the steaks.  The ribeye simply wasn't cooked properly, as the fat was not melted enough, making the mouthfeel terribly unpleasant.  The sides came slowly after the steaks.  The ""family style"" fries were large enough to feed a family of 1.  And they also missed a side as well.  For dessert, many of us simply opted for a coffee.  Safe bet for a quick ending, right?  Wrong.  Half of us asked for regular coffee, the other half ordered coffee with liquor.  The regular coffees came up about 10 minutes before the other ones.  When they were brought up, the waiter goes ""who ordered the regular coffee?""  Our response was simply ""The ones who ordered the regular coffee"".  As the Captain of a Waitstaff of a ""high quality"" steakhouse, how do you not know that?  Thats what you get asked in applebees.Bottom line: The food was not dreadful at best, considering the $2500 tab.  The service was probably the worst i've ever experienced at a restaurant of that caliber.  From start to finish, our experience was one i don't wish on any diner.  Their treatment of us gave the impression that they didn't care because we were Americans.  The sad part is we were all looking forward to this meal.  I don't regret trying the place, but i do regret tipping them at all.  They didn't deserve anything.  There's a difference between having an off night, and simply being bad.  There are plenty of steak houses in Montreal, so if you're gonna spend the money, DON'T GO TO QUEUE DE CHEVAL!"

Sorry, what?  If you don't know, say you don't know, don't give me some stupid answer about a subject that has nothing to do with the question.Anyway, on to the food.  We were four, and decided to each get something different so that we can try more.  Being a huge red meat fan, I went ahead and ordered the bone-in New York, rare.  Not only was it not rare at all, it was also flavorless, except for the pepper crust on top, which was lacking salt quite frankly.  But the meat itself was tasteless.We also had the Chilean Sea Bass, the Salmon, and the Tuna Tartare.  The Sea Bass was good, however, it was served with some sautéed mushrooms that were so offensive, we had to tell the server to tell the kitchen to never serve this to anybody else. It tasted of manure.I don't like salmon, so I did not try that dish, but the three others said it was too cooked and tasteless.  The Tuna Tartare was in fact a tuna steak seared in a sesame crust, so rare inside. But isn't that how you're supposed to cook a tuna steak.  That's not tartare in my book. The dessert was quite good, thank God!  We had the White Chocolate Cheesecake.The wine list is not that impressive, unless you're looking at the special list from the manager's cellar, which are obviously more expensive.All in all, La Queue used to be the in place for food and scene.  The scene was missing, and so was the food."

Overall, however, I was disappointed.First off, a disclosure: I am not a huge steak person. I like it, but I don't crave it. I don't eat it often. So you might wonder what I was doing at Queue de Cheval in the first place. It was a birthday dinner, and the birthday girl chose the restaurant. But my rating is for other reasons. The service was just kind of off. For the very high price you pay here, I would have expected much better. On the positive side, we started off with a huge and succulent lobster tail. I have never seen a lobster that big. But the steak tasted fairly average - good, but my mouth wasn't watering. The broccoli was ok, but very plain. The creamed spinach was good. They have a wine list that leans very heavily on the very expensive, designed-to-impress side. However, we managed to find a very tasty, somewhat reasonably priced Italian red that we really enjoyed. But I was savouring my last glass when the server accidentally poured another table's wine in my glass (mixing the two wines together). Ok, accidents happen, and at least they apologized and brought me a new glass of wine. But the replacement wine wasn't in the same league as our original bottle and so I lamented that lost glass. All in all, for the price you pay here I think you could find better food and have a more enjoyable experience elsewhere."

The waitstaff are professional and well-informed.

The place was always a little over the top with the brash service style, but this was chaos.

We got some  shrimp appetizer that were huge and delicious...two of us ordered Delmonico's and were told they're were none and we'd have a Louis Cut instead. Steaks were produced for us to approve and I am certain these were not the steaks that we were served. The sides were good and fairly generous, but the steak? Charred beyond recognition and frankly flavorless. The dry aged steaks I remember from previous trips were vastly superior to what we were served. I make better steaks on my grill.

I'll mention the only loss of points up front: in the middle of our waiter taking our order, he interrupted me mid-sentence in order to help another server with another table. Not cool - when I'm paying $$$$ for a meal, I expect to be treated with respect and courtesy, and this was simply unacceptable. He tended to the other table for a good five minutes while we sat there and watched, menus still open. Aside from that gross oversight in etiquette (and possibly adequate staffing) my experience at Queue de Cheval was excellent. This is a classic gentleman's steakhouse.The steak was delicious. I had the Lou's Cut bone-in ribeye, rare-medium-rare. Cooked perfectly, marbled and tender, this steak was worth the $52. On the side, classics: creamed spinach, French fries, mushrooms, and a cognac au-jus sauce. F*ckin scrumptious. Paired with a Brunello di Montalcino (Casanuova '04 for $165), damn that was good.Beware the wine list - they have some serious, and seriously (over?)priced bottles here, including '82 Petrus for a clean $9,900. There are, however, more accessible options starting probably in the $50 range.After the meal, enjoying a cigar and cognac in the cigar lounge? Now that was the kicker. A perfect end to a man's meal. Once again, pricey - Hennessey XO and a Bolivar ran us $100+ each, but what an experience. Sitting in an OG bar - oak, red velvet lamps, and bombshell waitresses - watching the end of a hockey game with a cigar and digestif... the way a gentleman's meal should end.All in all, I can't wait to go back. Bidding farewell to the hostess (dressed in pseudo-lingerie, of course) and departing to confront a lineup of Ferraris and Porsches; such an evening can properly inspire a man such as me to pursue greater heights - always nice to get a little intrinsic value out of an evening of masculine-delicacy indulgence, even though it can (and will) likewise inspire a man to immediately pursue additional unnamed venues, such as those I'll review next ;)"

My first Canadian review deservedly must go to Queue De Cheval. While it wasn't the #1 tasting steak of my life (it was in, say, the top 5), this restaurant ranks #1 for ""Coolest Steakhouse Experience"".The restaurant itself is two stories and is completely beautiful. The staircase and art alone is worth the trip. The bar tucked into the side corner is full of dark wood accents that you would expect at a premiere steak place like this. There are large windows on both stories that open up towards downtown Montreal and Centre Bell (that's ""The Bell Center"" in American). The service was also fantastic. I was living a hockey's fan's dream of going to see the Leafs/Habs game across the street right after dinner, so the place was impossible packed. However, this place was prepared. I've never been served so quickly and efficiently but without being pushed or hurried in my life. The waitstaff and busboys were literally jogging through the aisles of tables trying to get to everyone at once but they did so with style and...grace? If that's possible - they did it. The big highlight is of course that, either before you order (on request) or right after you order (always), they will actually come by your table and show you the raw slab of beef they are about to cook and you are about to ingest. This is for several reasons:1. Showmanship2. Class3. So you can pretend to be a true connoisseur and make either affable or snide comments as to the cut and marbleization of the meat and approve/reject their selection.In any case, it's always fun. They also do this with the Jumbo Lobsters they have on the menu. Lastly, as far as service, you are offered ""sparking or still"" but it is actually ""Pellegrino or Evian"". I asked for plain tap water but they insisted on this choice. They didn't bother to mention that both were completely free and included in the meal in unlimited quantities! This is an awesome, perfect, and brilliant idea I've yet to see replicated anywhere.As for the food, the steaks were prepared in simple-but-true steakhouse styles without the fuss of a billion rubs/sauces or other distractions. The sides were huge and delicious - particularly the asparagus. You must get the asparagus. As other mentioned, they also specialize in lobster. The old man sitting next to me ordered a lobster that was about equal in size to my torso. I'm not kidding - it was hanging off the table. Awesome.I'll leave analyzing their wine list to people who know more than I do on that, but they did have ample selection of both local and national Canadian brews, including of course everything from Unibroue in Quebec, which you might expect.Other cool things: They are very accommodating if you tell them you are going to see Les Habitants across the street (that's ""I'm going to see the Ice Hockey Game featuring the Montreal Canadiens"" in American). They are aware of the game's start times and modify the speed of service accordingly. They are also completely understanding if you walk in wearing your Hockey sweater (that's a ""jersey"" in American) and blue jeans. They even managed to protect a couple wearing Maple Leafs gear from the excessive heckling of everyone around them.I can't praise this place highly enough. When in Montreal, you must go to a hockey game, and you MUST go to Queue De Cheval for dinner."

Was there as part of a conference that was going on there during the week, but was able to convince my friends to join me there for a weekend of debauchery and mayhem...alright, I'm not that young anymore, but it was supposed to be a good guys trip. So what do guys eat on a guy's trip...steak..... I actually wanted to go to Au pied de Cochon, but they were booked for days. So this was the next best place, well at least accordingly to Yelp. I wasn't quite sure about this place so asked everyone I met about this place to get an opinion. One person I talked to was telling me that the steaks are so great, that when you drive up, they park your car for you. ????? That is called valet service and what the heck does that have to do with steak? So there are four of us. We get there at 9pm. Busy, but most people finishing. The place reminded me of the Brooklyn in Seattle. Pretty neat how they have the meat locker on the side and a grand staircase going up to the next level just in the back. The first thing I notice is that the dry aged steaks are hung up in a locker and seem to be cut when ordered. The service upon sitting was fantastic. We had three waiters buzzing around us at any one time. So can't ding them on service. As we prepared to order, they went through the standard spiel on how meat is aged, wagyu beef, marbling, blah blah blah. I really hate hearing this, but I guess that is what you get when you go to steakhouses these days. (Well, you don't get this at the Met. They seem to assume you're there because you know your meat else you would ask. YES...I'm biased). All the beef was American less the Wagyu which was from Australia for some reason. I honestly can't remember the sides being too extravagant. I know we had some roasted garlic mashed potatoes and some other green vegetables, but by the fact that I don't remember is probably an indicator that I was either too drunk or didn't think they were worth remembering. I'm sure it was the latter. Two buddies ordered the Porterhouse and myself and the fourth ordered the Kansas rib-eye. Yes, Medium rare. The steaks came. Presentation was standard. Grilled to order. Nothing different. Took the first bite....nothing. Just a chunk of rib-eye grilled to medium rare. I believe I had to add some salt to it because it didn't have any flavor. The porterhouses were just okay too according to my carnivorous friends. One really liked it, but he isn't too discerning about food, so will have to toss out his judgement. The prices were pretty high too, so not sure why the high prices for such low quality preparation. The cuts sounded great, but again, anyone can buy the meat, not everyone can cook it. We were rather disappointed by the food, but fortunately, the only reason they got two stars is that they have a cigar room for you to wash away the taste of the bland steak with a nice Cohiba Siglo VI and a single malt neat. If you have to eat here, then ask for a spot upstairs. It is more happening. When you order, ask if they could send the valet to Schwartz's to pick up some real cuts of meat or just share a couple appetizers and then head straight for the cigar room."

However, as many reviews have pointed out, it is extremely costly, which is what prevents me from giving a full 5-stars.The meal was delicious, with very few low points. On this trip, I treated myself to the ""Lou"" cut, the house special. It was an extremely marbled rib-eye cut on the bone, that was more than juicy enough to stand alone. Spiced perfectly, my only surprise was that it was not as rare as I might have hoped; at fine steak houses I usually expect medium-rare to run on the rarer side, but I cannot really blame the restaurant for the inconsistencies among all restaurants.To the sides, the garlic mashed potatoes were superb, and the fried onions were quite good as well. The home made pickles were delightful and humongous. The only disappointment I had was with the cheese covered cauliflower which tasted undercooked to me. For dessert we had an extremely rich chocolate covered cheesecake that was creamy and melted it your mouth; if you can take rich desserts, I highly recommend it.In the case of the steak prices, I can certainly forgive the restaurant. In point of fact, while the steaks are on the upper end of steak prices, they are not absurdly more expensive than any other steak house. The true pain is in the cost of the additions. $14 Canadian for so-so cauliflower with cheese? $16 Canadian desserts? These are the prices that really rack up the bill to the $80 or so per person we spent.If you're willing to spend the money, it's a great experience, for taste, decor, and service. However, the prices do hurt."

They said this was only temporary until the new and final space is done being renovated but I don't see myself coming back ever again. In a city with so many options for a good steak dinner, you can't justify spending $50 on a cut of beef especially when they burn it. Not impressed, stay away until at least a few months after the new/final location opens up; and even then I would wait for reviews before visiting."

First the excellent parts... The service of the staff was lovely and attentive. They worked very hard to make sure we had every tiny thing attended to, and did their best to make us feel cared for despite difficult circumstances. The refrigerator with the aged meat looked impressive when we walked in, and the steak was cooked to the level I expect from most nice steakhouses in the  Midwest of the United States (which I think are often quite good). The cons: the table we sat at was in the middle of the room and clearly in the way of the servers. So, the room could use some rearranging for traffic that would make it easier. However, my biggest complaint was the owner who literally screamed and swore at the cooks about carrots multiple times over a 15-30 minute period, eventually loudly firing two of them in front of all of us. The rest of the staff was quite upset and did their best to carry on as their colleagues literally packed up and had to leave the restaurant through the dining room, but the bullying of the cooking crew by the owner was really quite upsetting to me. Also, we ate the same steak, and my husband got this great big burly sharp steak knife, and I got a petite dull one. There was only one woman in the kitchen, and the only other two women I saw there were the body con dressed hostesses. So, maybe a good place for the guys, but not a great date night sort of place. My husband and I joked about the ""chauvinist knives,"" the rest of our trip. Sad the owner made his restaurant look bad when his staff was actually doing a good job despite the toxic environment."

It would come in second place to McDonald's in terms of the quality of their meat.First, the good stuff. The restaurant itself is beautiful, especially the second floor with its stone walls and brick ceiling.  There was also nothing to complain about regarding service. Also, the seafood they served us was fine.Now the bad. They bill themselves as a steakhouse, so it does not seem unfair to judge them on the quality of their steaks.  We were a party of seven, four of whom ordered steak, a ribeye,a filet mignon and two New York cuts.  The ribeye and New York cuts were inedible and the filet was mediocre at best.  They were not giving this stuff away.  All the steaks were in the $50-70 range, ala carte. They also had a wine list that was a joke. I know wine in Canada is priced higher than the US but there were wines that were 2 to 3 times more expensive than they would be in an overpriced American restaurant."

The bun was also over-toasted, making it quite hard on the outer shell. But the worst part was at one point while waiting for our burgers, someone from inside the restaurant (maybe 25-30, wearing a suit) came to hang out with the cooks, and was eating fries out of the basket without gloves, dipping them directly in the poutine gravy...didn't see if he double-dipped but it still seemed very unsanitary!"

We also ordered the lobster tail which was also tasty. The sides were enormous, complimented the meat well and otherwise were unremarkable.We had heard the place was pricey and were prepared for a large bill. The ribeye, lobster tail, two sides, a dessert, and two drinks came to about $250. Even though the place was quite good, I sit on the fence as to whether it was worth that much money. I guess I would put it this way: I think the meal was well above average, but I can still think of several restaurants that will serve an above average meal at half the price. If you've never been and want a cool experience, go and enjoy, just be prepared to pay quite a bit for it at the end."

We got a bottle for about $160 and that was the 2nd cheapest. It wasn't all that great. I didn't order any appetizers -- some of my friends did. One ordered the tempura lobster tails -- and they loved it.  I wanted to order the 3 Mignon Sampler -- but guess what they were out of them. A steakhouse out of steak? Oh well. I opted for the baseball cut Filet Mignon. I must say it was a nice piece of steak -- however, I ordered it medium well.. and it was too rare for my taste. We also ordered the mashed potatoes and they were okay.My friend and I ordered the white chocolate cheesecake and  it was terrible.

Huge disappointment, and the overall flavor was nothing to write home about.The creamed spinach and potatoes were nice, but pass on the side of broccoli, which was bland and luke-warm by the time it made it to the table.Fortunately, we were comped our appetizers and drinks given the length of the wait and the poor cooking, which was a nice gesture; but a repeat customer of this establishment I will not be."

Pretty loud with a dark wood interior.  Lots of hot tall hostesses in black leather and the girl-guy ratio is probably 1-7...maybe this is where women should go instead of bars to meet men. As for the rest of the food, I really enjoyed my swordfish.

With a 97$ porterhouse for 2, we were expecting a pretty amazing steak but we were so wrong. We'd both describe it as ""acceptable."" The steak was not given a chance to rest and was cut into right off the grill, leaving us with a fairly dry steak before we could even start. To start the dinner, we were given some cold bland tasting bread. The iceberg wedge salad my wife got was just ok. You would think for a 15$ salad - the bacon would be a little bigger and taste less like bacos. I got 2 jumbo shrimp grilled with a tomato jalapeño salsa(12$/shrimp), which was probably the best part of the meal. As for the steak, we had ordered it medium as my wife doesn't like the steak to be bloody but when it arrived it was still quite rare and had to be sent back, essentially killing the steak.

Condiments not required; probably a result of the marbling seen when the steak was presented before my eyes before grilling. Sides aren't anything special - the focus here is the meat.

Before we ordered the service was commendable upuntil I expressed to the waiter I was not satisfied with something that was added to the steak. I asked for the ingredients and cloves was mentioned. Though I haven't been clinically diagnosed with an allergy to cloves it does not agree with me and causes me to sweat profusely and upsets my stomach terribly. The waiter asked if there was anything wrong and I explained this to him. He said he wouldvtake it back and have them scrape off the sauce ,though by that time The taste had gone through it and my reaction to the cloves had already begun. It was then the service stayed away so I asked for my bill. At this time he asked if I was satisfied I reiterated that I wasn't and he again asked if I was allergic and I again told him cloves do not agree with me. I saw him talk to the manager who did nothing ( you would think a place claiming to have the best steaks would have did more to make sure their clientele left happy) I was charged full price $140 for 2 drinks a rack of lamb and a steak dish that was barely touched. In any case as much as I like a good steak I will never eat there again and I will be certain to inform my friends. Not impressed"
