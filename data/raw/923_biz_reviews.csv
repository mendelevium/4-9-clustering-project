What a quirky local place with great food and even better service.The bread was amazing and the fries to die for.It looks divey but you will be really happy.The meats are cooked perfectly ( had the half chicken with peppers and fries) I ordered the calamari app and while tasty was a bit too small but they brought me more bread and I was happy.If you need a quick affordable meal be sure to check it out.

The Patio allowed us to see everything that was going on in the gay village and enjoy some fresh air. The gentleman that sat us was beyond friendly. He quickly took our drink order and frequently checked in with us. We ordered a simple half chicken which was very juicy and fantastic flavor. We are American so trying to decipher the menu was a little difficult but nothing that google translate couldn't help. The drinks that we ordered were a little water downed but overall the experience was alright. It was a quick stop with okay food and fantastic service. One thing is I wish they had ketchup bottles instead of individual ketchup packages. It just makes it easier for fries and stuff.

Three tables arrived after us and got served and we were just 2 people. Cannot say if the food is good or not, but the salad they served when we arrived as an appetizer had sand on it. Never taking chances at this place again."

Generous portion salads and bread! Food presentation is nice as well. The lamp chop I had was just ok, but the grilled chicken was delicious!! Will come back for the chicken for sure!! Friendly owner! You can tell the owner put a lot of thoughts behind this restaurant. It's a bit hidden and the outside window doesn't do this place the justice. Highly recommend to give this place a try! It's a bit a romantic spot since not a lot of people know about this place!"

You're basically dining in an antique shop which is fun and not the dusty mess of my nightmares.  This place is located in a modernish strip mall in the gay village so the inside is like a portal to another more delicious dimension. We had the grilled sardines and grilled calamari appetizers, which were excellent. The choice of 5 meats dish was an awesome deal and the best variety in town.  Piri piri is homemade and spicy deliciousness. Service was very nice. Problems: they only serve fries as a side dish. I don't eat fries, so I left hungry. There was a salad to begin with but it wasn't enough to supplement a side. Really wish they had a grilled veggie side option or appetizer or something.  This is a constant problem in Montreal in general so I can't fault this restaurant in particular, but they do have a healthy menu so it doesn't make any sense that they wouldn't have veggies as an optional side dish.  Sauce is served in mugs with basting brushes sitting in it which is seriously gross considering how many people have touched it/ breathed on it/ slathered already chewed bits of meat with it. Also the music was just awful, full of ads and kept fading in and out, didn't fit the atmosphere and it was dreadful light electronic house music. Not suggesting that the music should be all Portuguese or light jazz or anything, just something less terrible than what was playing.  It really ruined the experience."
