/user_details?userid=iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,David M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"500th review for a cherished restaurant i've had over 500 times.Why is this place in a non-commercial part of town so popular going back decades? It's a secret sauce that tings and tangs everything it touches.They have had their ups and downs (such as replacing the greek oregano brushed bread with ciabatta) but are now firing on all cylinders.I grew up on Marven's since they were right behind our house and by our school. What drew us in was their fries and their sauce which is so addictive it needs it's own 12 step program.90% of my meals are takeout and always involve fries and souvlaki sticks or pitas. They are less conical than other places and the tzatziki less tangy but man it is a delight.Getting souvlaki sticks is a great option since the pork or chicken really stand on their own and less caloric.It's honestly not the prettiest food but fits any occasion:Back from a long trip? Marven'sToo cold to go out? Marven'sNice Summer day? Marven'sMy go-to options when eating are different, I will get the calamari and rib steak, which is chewy, fatty, enormous and lusciously covered with mushrooms.It is a jewel in the Montreal Crown of Epic Restaurants, top 10 must-haves in this fair city"
/user_details?userid=iVXISIgh-unsJz57-qOHTQ,Sheryl L.,"Candiac, Canada",4 star rating,I've heard so many good things about this place especially their calamari so I was praying I wouldn't be disappointed and long and behold it definitely wasn't!I ordered calamaris as entrée still pretty good size! I wanted the gyro but at the time I went they were sold out. So I got the porc pita plate instead with rice and Caesar salad. It took me 40 minutes to drive from the restaurant back to south shore and I'm 100% happy to say the calamaris were still so good!! They weren't as crispy (not their fault) but it wasn't rubbery or dry as most places! They were still warm and had a good taste!Thé porc pita was good and huge! Good amount of tzatziki sauce in the pita very filling! My only note would be to add some spices or something on the fries since they're very bland and ordinary. The service was great host was friendly and patient as I was trying to decided what to order since they were out of gyros. We had a big order and it came out pretty quickly! Since it's COVID it is CASH ONLY! They are planning to open the resto for sit down dinner in a few weeks. Can't wait to go back and tastes the gyro!

The salad was tasty and fresh but I didn't like how they served it. The service was terrible. I felt that they didn't want us there.
/user_details?userid=JoVrzT6QTcTeRmXQdQg02w,Yvette G.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here for lunch with a friend after hearing so many good reviews of this place. When we arrived, they told us their ventilation was broken so it was very smoky in there. I insisted on staying since I had been wanting to try their food for a while. We ordered the calamari and spanakopita for appetizers. The calamari were delicious but only came with a lemon wedge, no sauce. The spanakopita I found was dry and didn't have much taste. For the main dishes, we ordered the chicken gyro plate and the pork gyro plate. Both meats were SO good! Tender, juicy, flavorful! The salad was okay, a bit too vinegary. The potatoes were good. And finally, the rice lacked flavor, I barely had any. They didn't have a lunch menu and I found that the regular price was a little high. All in all, I enjoyed my experience here and would definitely come back for the meat!"

A legendary spot in Park Ex. We showed up for lunch. They're open for takeout which is good during the pandemic. They have the popular Greek favourites. I ordered a pork skewer and gyro pita. The pita was moist and delicious. Loads of garlic. The skewer was dry. I'm glad they're open. I'm sure it would have been better eating in. Bring cash, don't bring a vampire and bring a healthy appetite. Nice portions."
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This restaurant serves the best fried calamary ever trust me on it! There are thick juicy tender crispy and it comes enough to feed at least two people as an entrée. My husband and I also shared a two sticks of chicken souvlaki plate but I must admit that I've had better elsewhere. Service is friendly and the ambiance is ok. Keep in mind that it's cash only. There an interact machine in the basement where the restrooms are but with all the extra fees, just be sure to carry some money on you."

Ordered a plate with two pitas to share and it was too much! and cheap! The sandwich was delicious, great flavours in the meat and the sauce was tasty. The plate itself is salad, fries, and rice and the plate alone is enough to stuff two people for an entire day. Service is friendly and efficient. Loved my time here. The only tiny thing is that they charge extra for sharing but since all plates are so big, it makes sense to share and we shouldn't have to pay more so as to not waste food."
/user_details?userid=iCtH3gYMxW9o0hiIz0jIeg,Dimitri P.,"Daytona Beach, FL",3 star rating,"Nice place, clean and comfortable location. The service is quick and on point. The food is over priced and not good the next day but, I did enjoy it while it was hot. They charge about $5 CAD more for there plates then they should. I had the pork platter with generous semi dry amount of pork. The chicken had a nice flavor as did the pork but 25 CAD for a salad, fries, rice about 8-10 oz is shaved dry pork wasn't ideal , they do give you a lot of potatoes ""French fries"" but it's to make up for the price they cheat you on. 25 CAD+ Plus taxThe calamari was excellent probably the best I've ever had in my life also the Greek sausage was fantastic as well., a little oily but it's to be expectedI may or may not come here again but I will think twice before I do because, there's so many other places in the area that can offer something at half the price and almost just as good"
/user_details?userid=VseHlPAVhHbNZqyl_zRKBQ,Stephanie C.,"Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Definitely one of the best Greek restaurants in Montreal! A small but busy restaurant, but great for family dinners or groups, located in the middle of the Acadie neighbourhood. They are known for their fried calamari which is amazing, being crispy yet juicy. Their pitas and stick chicken are seasoned and grilled perfectly, making them juicy and very tasty. Their platters are very generous in portions while being decently priced - the pita and sticks platter come with fries, rice and salad (with a light and delicious dressing).Being quite popular, there is usually a line up for this place, but it moves fairly quickly. Also, this establishment is cash only, so make sure to either withdraw some cash before hand or you can use their ATM machine! All in all, I definitely recommend this place for a family dinner or dinner with friends!"

They don't even have a proper space to change your baby! If you're a large group (like a big family) there's no way you can make reservation. So you have to wait in line! Especially when you go with kids or/and old people... it becomes difficult.

/user_details?userid=CgQsF5wV1_vz5KSBghYCwQ,Tom T.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Really enjoyed my dinner at Marven's! Located in a residential part of Montreal, it's got an amazing old school vibe when you walk in. If your from out of town and driving, pay attention as you may miss it. Also, leave time for Parking as it's difficult to find. Get here early as it filled up fast when we got here Friday night for dinner. We ordered the souvlaki platter, which came with some of the most tender, flavourful chicken I've ever had, great portion of rice and salad (they were ok) and some of the biggest fries I've ever been served. The Tzaziki here is better than my Moms, but I caution you, don't try it if you hate garlic because it's swimming in it. Being Greek, I didn't mind one bit. Your mouth will burn a bit! We finished it off with their strawberry cheesecake. I didn't mind it, but it had a lighter texture, so don't expect that New York style with heavy cream cheese. Great menu choices. I'll be back!"
/user_details?userid=D1_7CQpKK2SzK3Jduy8y8w,Anthony H.,"Irvine, CA",5 star rating,"While eating at Marven's, I was described as ""glowing."" I did feel that my happiness must have radiated as the food was absolutely delicious and left one of the most remarkable impressions on me. While I'm no connoisseur, I've had my fair share of eating at numerous restaurants and have rarely had the same impression I had here.I ordered the calamari and pork souvlaki and absolutely loved both.Calamari was flavorful and seasoned perfectly. The amount of salt they added brought out the flavor of the batter and squid, while lingering before the border of becoming overbearing.Pork Souvlaki came with fries, rice, and a greek salad. The salad tasted rich, seasoned and coated in a thin layer of olive oil. The rice tasted faintly of butter, but I can't say for certain; it had an emulsified, faint flavor to it which made it a nice compliment to the variety of seasonings in the other foods. I love my fries steak cut, like how they do it here and they were salted well. The Pork Souvlaki came heavily dressed with Tzatziki sauce, fresh cut tomatoes, onions, and pork skewers. While not tender, the pork was far from overcooked and easy to chew and tear; the seasoning paired well with the Tzatziki and left me craving more. I would recommend Marven's to any of my friends visiting Montreal."

But the service was just horrible. Not only did our waitress basically ignore us. I ordered the Gyro Mix which is one gyro pita and one chicken pita. She told me they were out of chicken souvlakis but I could get a pork one. no problem. I get my plate. I have one chicken pita and one pork. No gyro meat at all. I dint complain because I'm not the type. But still.... I don't get why she had to lie. My boyfriends gyro plate was amazing though. Also the calamari entree is tiny! For $15 we were all very surprised to see how small the plate was. Also they still do not take cards. Beware I saw some reviews that said they did... but they dont. Also the place is horribly loud and crowded."
/user_details?userid=eHYsne3HbyHJ0ws_1ASWfA,Juan Paulo A.,"Oakville, Canada",4 star rating,"Marven's  One of the best Greek restaurant  Location: The location is kinda awkward. You enter into a residential area with a large school nearby. The feel of ""one of these thing doesn't belong here"" pops into mind when looking at this restaurant. Strictly on street parking. Beware of the Montreal signs as they may be confusing. Also when winter hits, parking is cut to half. 3/5 stars Atmosphere: If you've been at a cabane a sucre/sugar shack, it has the same feeling. Depending if they are busy, you maybe seated next to complete strangers. And when I mean next, I don't mean next table, shoulder to shoulder. 4/5 stars Service: I've been to this place several times. And never once had bad service. Nor do I see waiters being rude to visitors to the city. Hostess alway polite, they alway spot on the wait time. It does get busy at times, but the staff is very efficient at clearing tables. Note to self, they do not take reservations for small groups, first come first serve. 5/5 stars Food: The quality of food has not changed. Although the portion may have slightly changed, I can't complain, the food is to die for.  Most people go there to try the calamari, and yes it is amazing, must try. One thing I do order on a regular basis is the girlies squid. And my wife's favorite, the lamb chops! I am drooling just thinking about their food. 5/5 stars Price: Well reasonably priced. For 3 dishes and a side, you're looking to pay about $40-$50. I don't know if they take plastic? Since I've been going there, I've always paid cash. Also I think there's a ATM in the basement next to the washroom. 4/5 stars Overall: This is one place you need to stop when in Montreal. Great food, great people! 4/5 starsFollow me for more pictures on:Instagram: 905japesTwitter: 905Japes"

I wouldn't say that it is the best restaurant for these, but their prices are competitive and the plates are huge! I can easily have leftovers for another meal when I eat there. One down side is that they don't take reservation and the restaurant is always crowded! So if you wanna avoid waiting in line, gotta go there early. They use to take cash only, but now they also accept credit card, woohoo!If you go there, must try their calamari and lamb chops!"

My family and I went there. I took the calamary with the souvlaki plate. The calamary only came with lemon no sauce. It was good but it had a little bitter after taste and it was a bit dry since there was no sauce. The souvlaki plate came with rice and patatoes no bread. The patatoes were flavor less same thing for the rice, it tasted like microwaved rice. My mom took the shrimp and chicken plate, it came with patatoes (I think) and some rice. The meat was good but not the rice and the patatoes. It was the same thing with the rest their orders, the meat was good but not the sides. Plus the price was a little too high for what they serve and the quality of it. I ate in other greek restaurants that had better food with more reasonable prices. I had to leave early because I had work early in the morning. I went to the cashier paid my bill, tipped the waiter and left while my family stayed. My family didn't t know that they had to add the tip, since in France the tip is already added to their bill. If they knew they would have tipped the guy accordingly, but the way the waiter went about it was borderline disrespectful, he legit forced a tip out of my family's hand."

It is a bit crowded to sit comfortably with kids but we did fit well. The menu is diverse and you have some nice options. We have ordered the fried Calamari and it was really fresh and tasty. As for the other dishes, they were good but not amazing. The food generally is good and this is why I am giving this place a 3 star. The service is nice and they were good, not a big smile but they were good. Be ware that they do not accept cards and only cash, so be prepared, unless you want to pay extra bank fees to use their ATM machine. You try it and you be the judge."

I've been coming here for over 4 years and I've really got to see this place grow and renovate. It should get a 5-star but as of recently, I feel like there's something going on with the food. Not in a bad way, NO ONE is poisoning anybody! I think I come here once every 5 weeks since their food is so addictingly delicious but I my most recent experience, their lamb chops are getting extremely tiny. I remember how much larger in size they use to be, but now it can't fill up my dad. Their standard greek salad also changed a bit, I believe they might've used different greens, but I feel it was lacking a lot of dressing and flavour (since they are using different greens). My caesar salad as well, normally I never have an issue and I'm just guessing this is only going to happen once, but my salad was premade long before I ordered it and was left in the fridge until I ordered. Honestly, I wasn't too impressed and would have said something, but I had a feeling it would only happen this one time. Plus I love this place so much, it's a little hard for me to hate it. But I think for a while I won't be going back too soon. Their greek salad and their lamb chops really changed."

Since then they've done a major renovation and has had great reviews recently so we decided to give it another chance. The famous calamari is sooooo small now! It used to come piled overloaded on a bigger plate. We also ordered pork pita and chicken souvlaki plate. It's either our palates have changed or they've changed their sauce and flavours. It was honestly just alright, meh to be exact. I've had better Greek food elsewhere. Not worth the drive for me."

Driving by you would pass it if you didn't even know it was there. It's a little hole in the wall located in an residential area.The porc souvlaki is the best I've ever had. You get 2 sticks of porc, rice, fries and a Greek salad for around $11.00. The sauce they make is incredible, i put that all over my souvlaki, fries and rice. They use to serve sliced bread toasted with olive oil, lemon and oregano on it, loved it. The new bread basket does nothing for me. It gets crowded and the tables are all set family style, i don't care for that because you never know who is next to you. Other than that this place is a must for really good food. If you have to go use the bathroom downstairs make sure your under six feet, must have been built for trolls."

We took calamari for a starter just half size because full is very big - more like a main dish. They are really good, fresh and crispy. But Greek salad is a mistake. There should be no lettuce in original Greek salad and more kalamata olives. In ours I found just 2 olives! And cheese wasn't original feta.Chicken souvlaki was just fine. Lamb chops - very good. Probably the best thing you can get there. But please... Lettuce in Greek salad? Only 3 stars from me :("

They don't take reservations and there is usually a line out the door. The portions are enormous and food is very consistent and reliable. And I guarantee that you have never seen a bigger portion of calamari in your life. Note that the calamari does not automatically come with tzatziki so you need to order this separately. Overall Marven's is a pretty solid place, however it is not particularly inexpensive and the line ups are long and I'm convinced that it is really worth all this. However, they do do takeout which is a good option if you need to get your calamari fix."

Ordered the rib steak, pork chops and chicken kabobs. ALL HUGERib steak, $27, thin, HUGE, nice charred taste along with it being cooked medium perfectly. So good, BEST THING TO PICK! Pork chops were good, but a bit bland. Cured with some sauce. Chicken was about the same as the pork chops flavor wise, but it was juicy!  French fries, rice pilaf and salad came with all entrees. Rice and salad, GOOD.Quick, hospitable service. I'll be back next time I'm in Montreal! Calamari seems like a hit, just be wary of the size of the entrees so you don't have too many leftovers!"

The bread which is given to start with could use a little more effort, but that's okay if you're good with adding some of Marven's sauce which is a sour/savoury blended mildly hot sauce. The Greek salad is above average, which comes with most dishes. The lamb chops here are phenomenal and my favourite is the whole chicken platter which just tastes fantastic and is good for 2 hungry people. The calamari is one of my favourite Greek style ones. They only take cash, and I always forget to bring cash, but there is an ATM at the location."

The place was packed but they were able to seat our group of 8 quickly. If someone said we were eating at Marven's, I would've assume it was an American restaurant, not a Greek restaurant. It literally looks like they bought the place from a steakhouse and they didn't have time to redecorate the Canadian place. There were moose heads on the wall and a picture of Justin Trudeau. We ordered lamb chops, calamari, tzatziki, and spanikopitas. Greek salads came and so did the bottomeless bread. Spanikopitas get a 3/5, not crispy enough for me. Tzatziki was lovely (so 5/5 cause how can you mess it up). Calamari was delicious and deserves a 5/5 since it really hit the spot for dinner on a cold December night. As for the lamb chops, it was good but it was odd. It didn't taste like lamb to me. Not sure why and for that they get a 4/5. Marven's gets a 4/5 because of their large portions, yummy food, and bottomeless bread. It would be nice to get quicker service since the waitresses and waiters seems so busy. They were kind when you got their attention but it was hard to call them over. The portions are huge so think about sharing a plate."

I did not like the grilled chicken i had one time, very dry and no flavour.  Most dishes comes with a greek salad or caesar both good. Tzatziki is a must for me each time we visit.  Service is ok , orders get in quickly and usually without mistake . They did mess up the cooking of the meat few times but dishes were rapidly changed.

He raved about it, saying Marven's is an institution to the Greco-Canadian community in the area. I am happy we stopped by. We ordered a demi plate of fried calamari to start, and each an order of the lamb chops. I should also note there is a house salad included with the meal. The salad was nothing special, though the feta was exactly the way I prefer it: not too salty, and not too crumbly. The calamari was tasty (even more so with the house sauce). The batter was flaky but not crispy, and the pieces were quite big.The main was a plate of lamb chops (cooked medium rare), rice, and french fries. I knew on the first bite of lamb there was something special about Marven's 30+ year old marinade recipe. I doubt it is anything complicated but it has definately made an impact on the way I will approach Greek styled lamb henceforth. Juicy, tender, and tasty! The rice and french fries were a waste - I was too full and they did not make great companions for expertly cooked lamb. The lamb would have been perfect with a side of grilled veg (i.e. eggplants and tomatoes).For dessert we split a generous portion of baklava. I don't usually like baklava because it is too sweet or too hard. This piece was pure bliss. Heaven.In all I was satisfied with the meal. The portions are big. The staff is very friendly and punctual. The prices are fair: 2 plates of lamb, a demi of calamari, 2 beers, and a baklava amounted to roughly $75 before tax and tip. I believe Marven's is a must for home style Greek grill, just as La Village Grecque is for gyros."

Do not let the little house fool you, it's one of the best Greek cuisine you'll ever have. The lineups can be ridiculous because they do not accept reservations so try to go at a random time. They offer takeout but I'm not patient enough to carry that food all the way back home. The waiters are the most effective and helpful you'll ever meet. They are known for their calamaris and steaks. I usually share calamaris as an appetizer then I have a gyro pita, some salad and the fries. Sometimes I end it with the cheesecake (they don't always have it). The portions are huge.

All in all if you have a chance you MUST come here!  Great service, below average prices, triple A quality, and bigger portions than one could ever consume alone!

The servers are prompt and really friendly- the type of server where when it comes to tip, you open up your wallet and say ""take all the monies!""We were a party of four and ordered two gyro plates (each has two pitas), a calimari, and a tzaziki. So. Much. Food. The plates are crazy packed with fries, rice, the gyros, a massive salad with your feta, olive and peppers. It's perfect for two people, but an ordeal for one. We ordered the larger calimari to share and again, way more was given than what was needed to feed four people. They were crisp and fresh, super light, and totally hit the spot. The only criticism is that the smaller pieces were slightly overdone, as it took on a more rubbery texture. But that could just be me trying to be an amateur food critic.Just go-- and get ready to roll out of this place. Or if you're normal, you'll limit yourself and ask for a takeout box."

In a nutshell:-Food was greasy, no subtleties, no authenticity whatsoever. -Meat in pitas was literally soaked in yogourt and garlic mayonnaise. -Tasted like greek junk food (what you can eat in food courts and food chains)-The supposedly excellent calamaris were too greasy and tasted like they had been soaked in salty water for a long time. Did not taste fresh, at all. We ate way better calamaris at Tripolis, for example, or in other mediterranean restaurants. -Atmosphere was stuffy.-Greek salad and olives were mediocreIf you want to eat generous-portionned greek platters yet feel you've experienced an interesting culinary adventure, go to Tripolis (in the same neighbourhood).

Special mention for the steak and the Marven's sauce. The service is usually friendly and quick. Basically, Marven's is the equivalent of Napoletana but for greek food, which means it's delicious and always packed. I am awarding 5 stars, not because of the quality. In fact, there is some outstanding greek food in Montreal. The 5 stars is for the wonderful Montreal feeling you get when you are seated at one of their tables. It's cash only, but they have am ATM.

Where things went down hill was how cramped everything is. I was pregnant (but not huge) at the time and being short, it was hard to move around without having to go on my tiptoes so I could squeeze between tables and chairs. It just seemed like they try to squeeze in as many people as they can in a confined amount of space.The line up was indeed long.

Located in an residential area but very popular with Montrealers. After so many years, I went back on a Tuesday night thinking it would be less crowded, like I remebered it the small diner was full with much noise with the same decor, nothing has been really updated. I sit with my guests waiting for the waiter to come take our orders & trying to understand what one of my guest was asking me . After 10 minutes, the waiter comes with a basket of 3 breads asking if we wanted to drink something, we wanted a brand of Canadian beer but he recommended a Greek one which we excepted since he didn't have what we wanted. We also asked for water which he brought right away, spilling half of it on me. Another 10 minutes passes before he comes to get our orders. Out of the three orders, only one was available (hope so) since it was a porc souvlaki brochette. The other two dishes ( Lamb Gyros & Beef brochette) were not available. It seems they ran out!!!! Finally we get our meals, to my dissapointment,  the souvlaki porc meat was hard, the lamb skewer was extremely salty. The service was not great & the waiter not very efficient ( I guess he was tired of running around & being busy that night ;( . I will definitely not go back to that place , it kind of killed the opinion & experience I had prvious to my visit. It is too bad to see such deterioration in service & taste."

The prices are fair and the portions are HUGE but the food itself is not exceedingly flavourful or unique. They are known for their calamari which I have to admit is pretty good especially with their Marven's sauce. The calamari has changed over the years but it is still one of my faves. This restaurant is quite popular so expect a small lineup and a packed dining room. Seating is a little cramped and the interior is begging to be upgraded (moose head and everything) but I guess that's part of the charm. I keep coming here once in a while when I'm in the area just to get my fix but there are definitely other better Greek restaurants out there.

The place has a homey neighborhood ambience and seems to be quite popular. To be honest, I wouldn't go back. Not only were they out of chicken gyro at 6pm on a Wednesday night, the service was atrocious. We tried to make small talk with our waitress and she was all business, basically throwing down plates of food at us. Every time we asked her for something, it was obvious that we were bothering her, she was very rushed and incredibly rude to us. As far as the food goes, the bread is terrible. Tastes like an old loaf picked up behind a supermarket on which they've sprinkled some dry oregano. The Spanakopita were pitifully small (two for 4.00) , burnt, and not even homemade (i recognized they were the KRINOS spanakopita triangles immediately). The main dishes were a little better, but at 14.00 for a chicken pita with some fries, limp, flavourless salad and undercooked rice, it's not a steal. The worst part of the evening was when we asked to have our bill and the waitress told us they were ""cash only"". There are no signs indicating this anywhere in the restaurant, nor is it written on the menu. Since there aren't many banks within close walking distance, you're forced to use the ""blue-chip"" ATM downstairs (where the owner takes a nice $2.50 fee in addition to what your bank will charge you). Considering that this is Montreal, it's very surprising how long this restaurant has lasted. Their gyros and calmari (which we didn't order) must be out of this world in order to keep such a sub-par establishment in business."

Marven's also offers easily the best deep fried calamari in Montreal. Light, crunchy and melt-in-your-mouth goodness!There's a reason why there is a virtual line up for a seat here practically every night of the week: the food is amazing, it's as authentic as it gets, huge portions (enough to feed a horse for a week) and very, very reasonable prices. Every Greek person I know in Montreal makes a regular pilgrimage to Marvens and you should too. Yes, service is brisk, the waiters and waitresses are constantly on the go but they're always friendly.Ok, so the decor is a bit on the tacky side, but so what? Marven's is a place to eat, not to sit pretty.BTW, this is NOT first date friendly food. While the tsaziki is delicious, it's also very garlicky.I've been coming here since the 1970s as a kid, so even if calamari or souvlaki isn't your thing, the quails, the lamb chops and the steak with smothered mushrooms are also winners.

/user_details?userid=aIqDek9d1fDEgLIAWXMGSA,Robert L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",3 star rating,"I have been going to Marvens since the mid 70's, in fact the know this place when it was a dep and then a pizza joint. Owners have been friends from way back. But as we all know times change.  Marvens used to be a 5 star for many many years and leaders in the souvlaki biz. But something went wrong about 7 years ago. Now its all about the money and turnover. Would I go back?? Hell yes I would, its part of me. Their portions are still big, quails used to be amazing but not anymore. Salads not as good as I remember but the Calamari is still good and yero is still decent. Bathrooms there were always gross and then one day they fixed them up but it did not take long before they were back to gross. Avoid going down there. They never took time to keep them clean. Service is poor, same people for years...The girls just do not smile, I remember them b=from way back then when they were pretty and smiled for their tips now they just dont care. Would I recommend this place?? Yes!!! But they are not the leaders anymore....they gave up the title a long time ago.Shame"
/user_details?userid=JGjtkOtTs8oFg0AhAeyPVA,Rannie B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"A neighborhood Greek restaurant, close to Jarry park,  with very casual decor. The one outstanding dish there is their fried calamari. It is, by miles, the best in the city. Well worth the detour if you are a fried calamari fan.  They fry up gigantic quantities of it daily.  Whether you get it to take out or eat it in the calamari is always melt in your mouth tender and the batter is crisp, flavorful and not too oily.  Unless you have a large appetite or you want to share it with someone, I suggest you take the entree and not the main course of calamari.  The portions are huge and the price is fair.The rest of their offerings, mostly souvlaki and steaks, are ok.  Their large fries are very good.  None of it worth the detour to this more remote part of the city.Be warned that this place is always bustling and there is most often an uncomfortable and long wait in a very tight spot or even outside at lunch and dinner. Which is why many folks call ahead for take-out.It was featured a couple of years back on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives."

/user_details?userid=yRgJ0HkDOkA0UeE09CiXAw,D D.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"one of the best greek restaurant in montreal , over the years  food did it changed i go here since late 80s , my review about this restaurant is not about the food it's about how dirty yes you guys heard me right dirty it is. carpets are so dirty oil olive is dripping on to the carpets while they are serving the food ? if you look carefully you'll find leftover food under the tables from previous customers it's just not a pleasant thing to see. but most importantly when you leave the restaurant your clothing your hair your skin smells like grease why? poor ventilation , in this restaurant nothing has been changed over the years infact owners are so cheap they dont want to renovate the place. with all the money they make they dont want to put there hande in there pocket   ( i guess they have a scorpion in there pockets ) shame on them for beeing cheap to there loyal customers. i guess they don't care about there clients . to whom it may concern please shut your doors for a month and renovate this stinking dirty restaurant after 50 years its about time what do you think? most of all do something about the ventilation system , buy  some new tables new plates put new flooring make  the restaurant decent again.am I talking to walls? Most probably Iam ."
/user_details?userid=x4zA3pJQq9sEcfU7NCVroA,Kid O.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2 star rating,"It must be a new management/owner because the plate of fried calamari is really very small compared to what it was even last year (and more expensive). Before, you could share a plate with your other half, but now you have to eat also the whole basket of bread to fill full. That's sad because Marven used to be a great place to eat calamari and drink ouzo."
/user_details?userid=g1jSKLnE8sA4dNVMl5Yr_A,Vincent C.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I've been going to Marven's for 30 years. It was one of the places in the city that I could take out of towners and have them rave about it. That has changed. The last couple of times were not good. You can tell right away that the meat had changed. Every cube on the stick was the same size which leads me to believe that they have subbed out the meat process, which they used to do in the kitchen. My suspicions were confirmed when I bit into it. It tasted very bland. I'm sad to say that I won't be going back. Too bad. I used to love it."

/user_details?userid=KIBnDrvylvrvhr4Ow6OIAw,Edgar M.,"Villeray-Saint-Michel-Parc-Extension, Canada",5 star rating,Marvens is a Greek restaurant. Service is really good and so is the food. But the only problem is the tzatziki. You must order some on the side because they serve very little in the souvlakie pita's.
/user_details?userid=gUA8X7pgBowBtGTD1ZKAMw,Kristabos B.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",2 star rating,"Went there last night. I had mixed feeling about going because of all the negative recent reviews.I had no problem walking in at 7 PM and getting a table. My friend told me after that 15 years ago, the lineups started around the block. I don't know what happened (whether they changed owners or just chefs) but it was mediocre food at best. A lot changes in 15 years and there are so many new and better restaurants for the same price (i.e. Jardin des puits on Villeneuve)Calamari starter was bland. I have no problem with frozen calamari but the texture was rubbery and the ""sauce"" on the table was just not good.I had the chicken brochette plate. The fries were decent although a bit greasy, The chicken was charred and super dry and the rice wasn't anything special. Such a shame. I had high expectations but the wait staff were friendly."
