/user_details?userid=Ro00qQOG5fIrFCXMStjzrQ,Nicolas C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is place has the best selection of banh mi I've seen in town so far: beef, chicken or pork prepared a bunch of different ways, and all the ones I've tried so far have been really good, especially the General Tao Banh Mi, which is every bit as delicious as it is weird and unexpected. Also, the imperial rolls that come with the lunch trio are great, and the deep fried shrimp are big, beautifully battered and tasty as heck. Plus, the prices are good, the counter service is quick and friendly, everything is made fresh (as far as I can tell) and served piping hot, and they're right across the street from my nearest metro station, so I'm going to be going back there a lot, no question. The restaurant itself is cute and clean, but it's not very big, and I can't vouch for how comfortable it is to eat on site because I've taken every order to go."

It always amazes me that a pho can arrive boiling hot when delivered! Very delicious! I would probably have thrown in a few hot sauce packets, but I had some at home. I have to commend Madame Ly on sending some very nice bamboo chopsticks, this made the experience even better!I also ordered a banh mi as a snack for the day after, which was very delicious, and a chicken dish which was very good too. I have to say for delivery it was incredibly fast! The delay time listed on uber eats was spot on, very very glad for that. I'd love to try some other dishes in person some time. Well done Madame Ly!"

Hubby and I were ecstatic to find a place that had both of our cravings. This resto serves crowd pleasing Vietnamese food. Not the best banh mi but many options available, even a general Tao banh mi! The traditional banh mi is acceptable if you are having a banh mi craving and want it delivered. The vermicelli and grilled pork bowl was excellent (esp if you love lemongrass) but it could've used more nuoc mam... gotta have my fish sauce. We've also tried to ginger chicken, fried wontons and fried rice, all of which were tasty and portions were generous. The prices are fair and the food is fresh. The resto is very luminous and located closely to st Hubert street. The staff was very nice and attentive (always a plus)."

Definitely did not disappoint - delicious soups and entres, friendly owners, bright and clean and simple. And the price was right."
