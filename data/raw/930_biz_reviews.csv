Lots of seafood options and a nice polished environment without being pretentious. The menu is pretty diverse, with a range of different price points. Seafood is always pricey obviously but cmon, cheap seafood would just be a recipe for disaster, haha. The one dollar oysters are actually quite good! Beautifully briney and simply a joy to slurp down. What a great deal. You can feel quite princely as you dine on these delectable morsels of the sea, without paying a princely sum.The takeout option is pretty great in these covid times. The lobster roll is incredible. Buttered bread, big lobster chunks, perfectly seasoned. The ribs and mash are also quite good and very filling. The platters of seafood are kinda pricey, so sharing is probably the best option.Overall it is a nice place, and I'll be back to fulfill my oyster fix."
/user_details?userid=pM0TeYvi-psSqh4DrrfD3w,Lily K.,"San Francisco, CA",1 star rating,"Usually, I understand that sometimes restaurants may not always offer what the customer was expecting. However, today I felt the need to write to you, because I am very disappointed with the order I received today, and frankly, feel that I was purposefully misled.I have seen Lucille's food truck, and it seemed really popular. I rarely eat out (on average, once every 2-3 months). So today, being in the area, I decided to try out the food truck. I asked the saleslady what I should get, seeing how I am not a big fan of seafood, and she recommended the cheeseburger and fries, saying that she herself really enjoys the cheeseburger. She was very nice and very friendly, and I took her advice. All in all, the cheeseburger (9$) and the fries (5$) came up to 16.10$ (with tip).When I arrived home and excitedly opened my box with the order, I was very taken aback.The cheeseburger is minuscule... I literally took a can and compared the size of the burger to the diameter of the bottom of a soda can. They were the same size, and that is including the bun! The diameter of the patty itself was smaller than the diameter of a soda can, and the thickness was less than the width of a dime.Seeing how the cheeseburger sells for 9$, I thought that common-sense would allow me to expect it to be the size of an average burger. Needless to say, the price of the burger, combined with the recommendation of the saleslady made me feel as if I was misled to believe that the Lucille cheeseburger was worth 9$. It was not.I am sorry to say that I do feel taken advantage of, and I expected more from Lucille.When I sent this same review to the Lucille customer service email, the response I received was the following:""Hi,I'm really sorry to hear about your experience. I will speak with the chefs to make sure the size of the burgers is respected off the food truck. I appreciate your feedback. Thanks and have a good weekend,""Needless to say, I felt completely dismissed. I am not going to return to Lucille."

At first feel, it was warm with the dimmed lights and cozy with the soft music. We were two and ordered 4 dishes to share, except for the last one - stay tuned. The calamari were delish, the chowder was okay, the octopus was fab, and my friend had the oysters and said they were great. The amount of food was just perfect. Our waitress was very helpful and polite, which I really appreciated. In all, I enjoyed my experience but thought it was a bit pricey."
/user_details?userid=vTsbejwscDEdA3Ao_aIQMg,Lawrie S.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is a monkland staple and very popular so make sure to make reservations ahead of time! Highly recommend if you are in the mood for some surf and turf.We started off with some $1 oysters which were super fresh and delicious with a variety of sauces. We also had the fried calamari with a delicious tartar sauce. Although the pieces of calamari themselves were very big, the plate itself wasn't so I would call it more as an appetizer/side. We then split the surf and turf combo which comes with one lobster roll, ribs and fries. This plate was definitely worth it and the ribs really surprised me, very juicy and melted in your mouth. This was more than enough food for two hungry adults.Although the food was really great, I did think it was a little on the expensive side for what it was. Service was also quite slow and it took us an hour to get just the oyster. That being said, I would go back any time for the ribs and oysters!"
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Lucille is a decent food experience but I found it off-target on a few things.Location reveals itself as a small modern chic resto and definitely not a dive as per the resto name. Being a small resto, the seating is somewhat limited and more importantly closely packed together. The resto gets pretty busy with a lot of foot traffic. Seat arrangements per table defer from one another and my seating arrangement was one of those slightly uncomfortable tall chairs. It does gets pretty loud in here with the music and other patrons chatting while they enjoy their meal or drinks. I definitely didn't expect that and completely welcomed the quietness once I left the resto.In terms of food I went with their Surf & Turf, something I heard from others and really wanted to try. This dish consists it's a lobster roll with a half rack of ribs and fries. Priced at $36 so I'll say it's pretty pricey. Lobster roll was definitely not lobster tail and I suggest eating it first as the bun gets soggy pretty quickly. Decent overall. The ribs were tender but were somewhat try with a lack of sauce. Fries were good. Overall, a decent plate but at the price-tag, I wouldn't have it again. We also had calamari, it was good but the portion was small.Service was good despite being things being super busy. Booking was online, easy. Paying a bit of a challenge but we got it done.All in all, a decent place if you're in desperate need of seafood. Not necessarily the best location if you want this in Montreal by any means but it's damn well marketed in Montreal so you have to experience it, am I right? Price is pretty expensive for what it is. My friend had a ""grilled seafood plate"" for over $30 and it barely covered the bottom of the plate. We wanted oysters but at $42 for a dozen, that idea was scrapped. The competition in Montreal provides a better price/value."

/user_details?userid=9nj5lry5KkSal22Oo9VGvQ,Cayla L.,"Brossard, Canada",3 star rating,"I came to Lucille's Oyster Dive to celebrate my birthday. The food was great but our table was placed in the busiest traffic area of the restaurant. We asked to be placed in a different spot but the restaurant was fully booked.  Our table was placed right next to the area where the hostess was standing and where people were waiting for their tables. It was extremely uncomfortable because while we were eating, people's bag would be shuffling near our dishes. I do not believe that they should add that table of 2 right in that spot because it was an unpleasant experience.For the food part, I would give it a 4/5. For the month of March, the oysters from PEI are 1$ each. We also ordered the wood-oven chicken and the 2 lobster rolls as mains. The wood-oven chicken was tender and delicious. There was a bit of char on the sides and cooked beautifully. It also came with a metal bowl of guacamole and 2 small tortillas! I was really amazed how good this meal turned out to be! As for the lobster rolls, this dish came with French fries or salad. The taste was pretty good, you can also find big chunks of lobster inside the buns. Overall the experience wasn't that great. I was really disappointed at where we had to sit. The food is very good! I would recommend people to ask for a better seat when reserving over the phone!"
/user_details?userid=XbiKsujS_qxU3xsr0xUqmQ,Cin C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Lucille's a real treat for those special dinners that you may be planning. The restaurant says 'Dive' but this is by no means a dive. It's a classy upscale restaurant complete with the lighting, leather booths and prices. The food is really really good and well prepared by the kitchen. We had the oysters, the NY strip and the roasted cauliflower salad. The NY strip was perfection and one of the best I've ever had. My friends swear by their lobster rolls which comes loaded with lobster meat. Also one order comes with two rolls, so it's perfect to share between a couple!Service was a little slow even though it wasn't fully packed. At one point I wondered if they would take our orders since they had left us with the menu for so long after bringing our oysters. Thankfully, the rest of the night turned out fine. Prices are on the expensive side, expect to pay for the quality and environment."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"While a dinner at Lucille's still has its highlights, Saturday night's visit was disappointing on multiple levels.While the Lucille's on St. Catherine is being renovated, I noticed the branch on Monkland has started taking reservations. I booked a table for 3 at 7:45pm on Saturday night. We get there at 7:40 and every table is packed. The maitre D could barely grunt at us while burying his head in a full sized Apple MacBook for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, we're standing in the doorway and nobody is telling us when we will be seated or what the problem is. Some eye contact or even an explanation would have been nice, but Mr. Maitre D was too busy looking important and officious. The only words uttered to us by the staff were ""could you move out of the way so we can pass by?"" More people started arriving and seemed to be seated before us. After about 8-10 minutes of the silent treatment, I was just about to go check out Taverne Monkland or Local 75 down the street when they called our name and sat the 3 of us at a table that was barely big enough for 2. In fact, the entire night, the doorway of the restaurant was jam packed with people who had to wait to be seated.The waitress informed us that Lucille's was offering oysters for 1$ each the entire month of February. I wasn't planning on getting oysters, but at 12$ for a dozen, what the hell, right? Big mistake. Lucille's should be ashamed of themselves. You get what you pay for. The first oyster I tried to eat wasn't detached from the shell. Of much greater concern however was the fishy and funky taste. Something didn't taste right. My wife and her sister both agreed that something was off. Clearly, Lucille's was serving oysters that they had no business selling. Thank god we didn't get sick. I think I had 3 or 4 oysters. Maybe 1 of them tasted right. We could have been very sick. What's worse, almost every table was ordering a huge platter given the price. If you're wondering why I didn't complain, it's because that's not my style. Yes I know they likely would have replaced the dish or not charged for it. It doesn't change the fact that subpar food is being served in the first place! The restaurant is called Lucille's Oyster Dive after all. You would think that they know their way around an OYSTER!The shrimp cocktail was quite good as was the salmon tartare. I opted for the rib steak which at about 55$ is on the pricey side, but worth it given Lucille's sterling reputation for dry aged beef. Unfortunately, the steak that was served to me was a few steps down from what I had previously ordered at this restaurant. The steak used to be quite thick. This time however, it was cut thin to about half of an inch. This cut is usually reserved for run of the mill delis and diners; not restaurants who claim to be specialists in steak. Yes it was tasty and cooked to my desired medium rare. That said, they had previously broiled it with a crispy and almost sweet outer caramelization. Think Ruth's Chris. This technique was nowhere to be found this time. The ""chimichurri"" sauce served with the dish tasted downright weird. (Try Tuck Shop for a proper chimichurri. Hint: It's not supposed to be completely soupy and yogurt -like ) Given the small cut of meat, and the pedestrian cooking technique, the price tag on this dish is about 10-15$ overpriced. It was still enjoyable, but I remember being absolutely blown away by their steaks in the past. This steak was a large step down from what they used to serve.Finally, while service was friendly, it was also somewhat lacking. I ordered a Red Stripe beer when I first sat down. As my main course was served, I pointed to my beer and asked the waiter for another. Thirty (30) minutes later, she comes by and says they are out of Red Stripe and would I like something else. I've already eaten my dinner. Of course that didn't stop me from getting a second one, but she should have been back to tell me that in about 3 minutes, not 30.When Lucille's first came onto the scene in Montreal it was a huge success. It's still completely packed, but from my perspective, it's slipping. You cannot cut corners and expect to get away with it in the longterm. Moreover, you cannot call yourself an Oyster Dive and serve rotting, old, decrepit oysters no matter what you are charging. It's a matter of public health."

They could've seated us until the lights came back like they did to the other two girls. Was looking forward to my reservation here. Sad. For the price , horrible customer services"

/user_details?userid=6iD6drB51smAYkvWR2vzmQ,D F.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Canada",4 star rating,Restaurant with atmosphere on Monkland street. They leave bottles of water on the table. I came with a group of 15. The service was slow and disorganized but maybe due to the large group. I got the fish tacos for the appetizer. It was really good. They ran out of shrimp zoodles which is what I wanted to get as a main. Instead I got another appetizer which is the tuna poke. It was very small and spicy. And it came on a friend crispy thing. I didn't like it. A friend got something that looked like chicken tacos. She said it was good and she asked for it not to be spicy. They let you bring in a cake from outside. I would give this place another try.
/user_details?userid=GQGvCTi2SvL9U_d3fsm9Tw,Stan C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"There are many places around town that offer $1 oysters. This is not that place, and thank the heavens for that!I ordered 6 oysters to start and was rewarded with a beautiful platter of oysters accompanied by tiny vials of vinegars and sauces that made the molluscs really sing.As a second course I had the half octopus (quadropus?) which was yet another fantastic course. Perfectly cooked, beautifully presented and one of those dishes that sneaks back into your memory, beckoning you to revisit the flavours. So good!!The missus had the clam chowder and enjoyed it, but she was disappointed by the fish and chips. She's a maritimer so her standard is pretty high. Mainlanders like me would probably think that it was fine.Do over? Probably."
/user_details?userid=A7YlcidsiAZzU-tCSsrTSg,Anny T.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I came here for the first time when they had the dollar oyster promo with my family. We were pretty excited to try this spot since my family loves seafood. Good: The oysters were great, they've got some great sauces that pair perfectly with it. The service was pretty friendly, despite how busy it was.Bad: When we ordered got our first 2 dozen oysters for the table, we've noticed that it was missing 4 pieces, so we had to notify the waitress. She told us that she'll add it in on the next 2 dozen round, but when we received the next round, it was still missing so we had to remind them again. The place gets packed really quick, so our table was uncomfortable close to everyone. Even going to the restroom proved to be an obstacle course.I just remember being underwhelmed by that $36 lobster roll and how there was barely any lobster. I don't really even remember much of the food because it simply wasn't outstanding.Bottom line: I couldn't justify how average the food was considering our bill was $200, but I did return again for just the $1 oysters. Aside from that, I don't think I'd want to try anything else on the menu."
/user_details?userid=W_CkghBYSgJIJYi44GBTPA,HanDan W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We've decided to go to this restaurant for Mother's Day because my mom is on diet and she enjoys seafood more then red meat. Since the restaurant is close to our neighborhood, we decided to give it a try. The oysters are really fresh but 21$ for a half dozen, I think I can find better deals elsewhere. The waitress suggested us to take the special of the day which was the grilled salmon with maple syrup glaze come with mixed salad on the side for 29$. This ended up to be my mom's favorite dish of the night. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the maple syrup just added a bit of caramelized sweetness onto the salmon.My grilled octopus  was also amazing. It was cooked perfectly, tender but not tough. The only complain about this restaurant was the price and slow service. Though everything was good, it was way too overpriced. The grilled octopus was 34$ for half portion. In addition, the service was pretty slow. Since I read the reviews ahead and I was worried about the slow service, we got to restaurant by 5:45 to avoid the crowd and we still had to wait for about 40minutes for the dishes. Regardless the long waiting time, staffs are courteous and attentive, and I don't mind to wait a bit longer for quality food. Just be aware of waiting time if you decide to go since they don't take reservations ahead."
/user_details?userid=l9fGOqjEQDEN10Pog3cMng,Xena W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Overall great experience. I highly recommend the Surf n Turf (for big appetites), which comes with a lobster roll, baby back ribs, and fries, as well as the cheesecake (so creamy!). Service is very friendly, the waiters are always kind and your water glass is always filled. The interior is very dim but it's a nice vibe. A bit pricey though: Surf n Turf was 36$, fried calamari starter (very small) was 18$, cheesecake was 10$. Still, I would recommend this restaurant if you're not on a budget!"

It's a dive alright- nothing flashy, energy was loud, I cracked up as loud as I wanted to and enjoyed every second.Lucille's warm lighting made the evening calm and really fun. Baseball was playing and Bluegrass set the mood in Montréal's funky spot. My cocktail was strong and, grilled lobster was divine. At one point, I didn't care diddly squat, who was around me because I went deep on that bad boy with both hands and enjoyed the rich taste of my Nova Scotia lobster. In all seriousness, Lucille's definitely a lively spot to be in and has been a return of ours!"
/user_details?userid=IARecFzHDe6j2OZtqhv5Cg,Lisa B.,"Pierrefonds, Canada",1 star rating,Ordered dinner from here a few nights ago and I was disgusted by how stale everything appeared to be. The lobster in the lobster roll tasted as if it had been prepared days before and after I tossed it in the garbage it was so rotten the next morning that it was stinking when I opened the garbage can. Will never patronize this restaurant again.
/user_details?userid=Q6f-wmLKk6kPIq648ybmbw,Shiran B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We went to the location on monkland, I was craving a lobster roll and when you crave lobster you think of this place! .. so I'll start off by saying that we ordered calamari, beef tartare & lobster roll. The calamari was out of this world! Honestly the best God dam calamari I ever had!! The beef tartare was another story.. it was a beautiful way to present a ""beef tartare"" however not for this type of restaurant! I felt like I was a judge on master chef which you think is a compliment for this dish.. which in all honesty it was really beautiful but I wanted something that I'll be comfortable to eat and enjoy digging into. Every element in that dish was placed perfectly. If I went to a more of elaborate set style restaurant it would make sense, but not for lucilles in my opinion they can totaly make this dish rustic and more in the flow of the rest of the menu. The lobster roll was all the yumms needed! And ofcourse the service was amazing as always"
/user_details?userid=P5f5Dx3_rL0znuE4wy77xQ,Sourabh M.,"Mississauga, Canada",1 star rating,We went to eat oysters and seafood. Too pricey for the quality that you get. The portion size of the main dish is small yet loaded with fries to fill your appetite. The servers are not helpful as they are trained not to customise your dish. Highly kid unfriendly place. One thing bothered me the most was that there was class system amongst  the servers. The order taker just took the orders and collected the tips. The food serving and clearing was done by hardworking associates who did not get any rewards. The waitress treated them in a derogatory way.  Coming back to the food - extremely fried non tasting food. Oysters were too small and waitress had no knowledge about the origin. They should learn from Pearl Diver in Toronto.

/user_details?userid=qnZkCGvLz6AB5cQN_J_pUA,Jack D.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",3 star rating,"First off, Lucille's recently moved a block down from its original spot. Which I was honestly bummed about, cause I was kinda looking forward to experiencing a more divey, been-around-for-a-long-time kinda seafood joint, with ship steering wheels and fishing net decor, maybe some black-and-white photos of old bearded fishermen standing next to 7-foot tunas. But alas, no such luck. The new location, while definitely more modern, does try to maintain some of that old feel. Wood paneling, some Harley engines hanging up on the wall, a ship hull overlooking the larger part of the dining room. But the refrigerated glass room filled with dry-aging beef brings us back to 2017. I dropped by with my partner for a quick oyster fix. And honestly, that was all we could probably afford. Didn't realize how expensive it was going to be. Again, my visions of a seafood dive thwarted. That said, the oysters were amazing. Also managed to budget some fries and grilled veggies to balance out our meal, and both were quite exceptional for what they were. Would I come here again? Maybe for that octopus. But otherwise, I think the better value would be to split a box of oysters with a couple homies and shuck em ourselves. I never thought of oysters as a fine dining kind of cuisine anyways."

/user_details?userid=WpVKYCaQralBtUtbbKUlrg,Rebecca C.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Would have given Lucille's 4 stars as the seafood was fresh and tender but the prices are frankly ridiculous. This is Monkland Village not Manhattan. Mixed grilled seafood 32$ included exactly 4 mussels, 3 pieces of calamari, two shrimps and two to three slices of chorizo. Came with a side of fries but it was the size of an appetizer. Complained to staff and they said sorry the chef weighed it out. Meaning they put what 100 200 grams of seafood? You can buy a whole bag of mussels for less than 10 dollars at the grocery store. Just chuck in some cheap whitefish but don't call yourself a seafood place then refuse to provide more than a teaspoon of seafood to your guests. If you can't make money at those prices then you are doing something seriously wrong. If you like oysters go to some buck a shuck place . 42$ for one dozen. I hope they were harvested by hand by a mermaid!"

I like oysters a lot, and wine outside, and crazy Ceasar cocktails with crab legs poking out of them, and very friendly knowledgeable charming service. Lucille has all of these things in spades and these are great ways to win my heart. Uncrowded on a weekday 5a7, the patio bakes in the sun for the first hourish but then the shade hits and the spot becomes more comfortable, and the crowds come sauntering in. The inside is cool, literally and figuratively, though walking sort of through the kitchen to get to the confusingly signaged washrooms is perplexing and of dubious hygiene. My biggest gripe: the oysters were overpriced and 3/4 of the ones I tried had shell in them. I don't mind paying for perfect, but this wasn't it. I had a lovely time anyway, but man, nothing sticks in my craw like grit in an oyster."

It's super busy but not over the top crowded like their other dive bar in downtown. The service is wonderful. Beautiful waitresses dressed very well and enthusiastic to please all of your requests and hunger! They have wonderful cocktails and fine wine selections to chose from. I went for their white zinfandel sangria and their grilled octopus. My friend had their snow crab. He was a little disappointed with the size since he usually gets the alaskan king crab from the keg white is way bigger and easier to crack open as it is already pre cut for you and easy to munch on hehe. However, I Was super satisfied ! I don't think i've had better octopus anywhere else and whenever I feel like having octopus this is my first option! I am super delighted with their outmost freshness and service you will not leave here disappointed! If you are looking for faster service I would recommend to dine at the bar where they serve the oysters quicker and build a more personal relationship with you ! Overall, the ambiance, food and service was amazing and I can't complain ! A++ definitely will be back yummmyy"

We ended up going because we were having a hard time finding a resto close by that wasn't going to close at 11 pm and also I hadn't been to the new location on monkland yet.  I had the surf and turf which is usually a favorite of mine but the lobster roll was small and soggy. So sad. It used to be way better!! WHAT HAPPENED to this place!?!! Also my ribs were overcooked. My boyfriend's piece was juicier and more fatty than mine so I had some of his because mine was dry. I liked the sweet potato fries better than the regular fries and I never say this because I usually find sweet potato fries are too sweet for what I feel should be salty. I had the Caesar and it came with two big shrimps, two oysters and one clam. I gave my bf the clam (Hahaha)  because I'm not a fan of clams and he did not like it. The oysters and shrimp were good though and I enjoyed the Caesar.I'm really hoping this place was just having an off night. :("

/user_details?userid=STGdWAW7jxJp3I7zvnQouQ,Stan M.,"Kahnawake, Canada",3 star rating,Don't believe the photo's of the lobster roll! That was the whole reason I went there with my family and we got two thin toasted buns with at least half of what is on the photos.  It was tasty but not worth the money.  Don't like to give bad reviews on resto's but if they were what we saw on here I would have been very satisfied...Sorry we feel duped. Clams were good but not great.  Fries were ok. Ribs were tasty and obviously were prepared with an authentic smoke style.

This one is and I can't wait!I hope to become a regular.A warm welcome to start. The waitress ( I usually don't like waitresses because I have had too many experiences of often ""rude just there for the money ungracious"" attitudes. I prefer the calm of a male server) was completely getting us, was cool as hell and efficient.The food: well I hang out in Maine a lot and am very picky with my seafood but I assure you (it will take me many visits but) there is not one item there I didn't want to try.  I had fresh oysters that the shucker served to the table personally. Very pretty presentation with homemade hot pepper-cilantro sauce and nice other classics. They have a great variety but the Daisy was my favourite. Chunky and salty but not too salty.Lobster Mac'n cheese amazing!The only downside in my opinion is the W/C being right beside the kitchen's open entrance. But it becomes a detail when you see how much attention and care is put into everything this place does. I'm half tempted to not share this place cause I want to keep it for myself!!!"

Service: The staff was super friendly and service was relatively quick. We sat at the bar so I'm not sure if table service was as quick. Food: Nothing to write home about. My date had oysters which she enjoyed, and the ribs as a main. She liked both the ribs and the side of fries, and said the sauce was super smokey, just the way she likes it. I ordered the beet root salad and sweet potato fries. The salad was good, but it wasn't spectacular. The goat cheese was more like cheddar, which was a disappointment. I expected crumbled goat cheese but instead got four slices of... well I assume it was goat cheese though as I said, it tasted like cheddar and had the same texture. The sweet potato fries were amazing and so were the regular fries. Nice and crispy on the outside. Ambiance: Way too f-ing loud. You can't hear yourself think in the place so for me, this is a fail. I really liked the space - I felt like I was in a bar on a beach somewhere. Would I go back? Probably not without earplugs."

My first bite made me instantly say ""mmmmm"" I will definitely be coming back for these although there was quite enough tempting choices to try next time. My sweet potato fries were ok, the regular fries were better, crispy with some skins on them, nicely salted without a greasy taste.The halibut was delicious, crispy edged, with a spicy kick to it.We passed on desert because we were stuffed.

Also like their grilled seafood with calamari, octopus, shrimp and chorizo in piri piri broth. My toddler daughter loves the fish & chips and ice cream sandwich.

We were charged 59$ for a ceasar salad with a bit of feta and pieces of tasteless octopus. This summer, we decided to give this Lucille's location another try. Upon arrival, we were greeted by an incompetent hostess, mumbling under her breath. It was a warm summer evening so we decided to eat on the terasse. After a 10 minute wait for out table (which is ridiculous considering the restaurant was empty), we were finally seated. As we were sitting down, the waitress told us we couldn't eat here because we had a quiet 4 pound puppy in his carrier. This has never happened to me, we are frequent diners in some of the most beautiful and amazing restaurants in Montreal and have never encoutered such a situation, especially on a terasse. If you're looking for a quality dining experience and and friendly staff, definitely do not even consider Lucille's on Monkland."

The ceasar was awesome Every item we ordered was actually delicious. We shared 3 appys and 2 mains. Was a bit excessive and slightly expensive  (270 for the 3 of us ) but the quality was there. My favorites were the seared tuna tartar, the calamari and the surf n turf.The fish tacos were good but not mind blowing.

/user_details?userid=5ycExK6bveb99W-opzNELg,Cynthia D.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"The worst possible experience ever. First, We were told there was a 10 to 20 minutes wait. After not even 10 mins we got a table. Second, We had just been seated when the hostess asked us to move because another couple with a baby needed the table. The couple had been waiting next to us and had requested for a table outside and our table was inside. We thought the hostess request was odd but we agreed to accommodate the couple with the baby and the stroller. Finally, the couple did not like the table and decided to wait for a table outside. So, we asked the hostess to get that table back. The Hostess refused arguing that the table was for four and we could not have it. However, it was the exact same table we had been given a few minutes before. When asked again the reason why we could not have the tabel we had just been asked to give the couple and child, the hostess said she was too busy and needed the table. As if we we were not going to consume anything. I wonder what the hell she thought we were doing in the restaurant. But the best when we asked to speak to the manager. The hostess literally ran to the manager and told her the situation. We were standing right behind her and when I asked if we could talk outside because it was to noisy inside, the manager said she could not talk to me right now because she had to go check on her tables outside. she came back after a few minutes saying that we could not seat outside but that she would be happy to give us a table inside. THE NERVE!!!! we never asked for a table outside, we always wanted to seat inside at the initial table that we had been seated. The manager was oblivious to whatever happened and with that we left. This is the worst place in Montreal. A place that does not even have a manager that would take the time to listen is not worth at all. If the food is good or bad it does not matter the hostess and management are rude and inconsiderate. I will never go back to that place and suggest you do not go either. Places that have staff such as these two ladies are destine to go down the drain."
