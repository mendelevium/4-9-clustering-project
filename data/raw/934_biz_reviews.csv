Not much to say about this place but the atmosphere is chill and the bartender was super friendly.  She was helping us find a music festival we kept hearing about from the people at Schwartz.Had Portuguese beer which was pretty good. I had the""Boreale Blanche"" which is kind of like a blonde..Food looks good, but we were still full from acrosss the street"
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Always up and down with this place. Sometimes they make the best salad like today and sometimes it's off.Today sangria was great and the food was good. My salad needed more tomatoes but other then that it's the best salad in Montréal. With the chicken and the avocado the dressing is incredible.It was windy sitting outside today so little bit of dirt was flying around but just gotta cover your drink and you're good to go. I have been coming here for a while now and today was a better experience.
/user_details?userid=VseHlPAVhHbNZqyl_zRKBQ,Stephanie C.,"Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"My friends and I made reservations  here on a Friday night to celebrate a birthday. The place itself was not too busy, and had an open space, letting us enjoy the nice weather outside. We placed our orders shortly after arriving, starting off with some drinks. Our drinks were served pretty quickly: their mojito and martinis were decent, but their Long Island iced tea and white sangria tasted off. After waiting about 30mins for our food and asking about it, our waiter decided to finally let us know that they are understaffed and that the food should come out shortly. Over an hour passes by, some people who have arrived before us have already received their food and we were still waiting. After almost 1.5 hours, we finally received our food, however they made some mistakes with some of our orders and forgot mine. They made mistakes with our poutine orders, and when we finally received it, it was disappointing and not worth the wait. The chorizo and cabane poutine contained mostly leftover bits of fries, and so much whole black peppercorns which ruined the taste! As for their Portuguese chicken plates, as much as they tasted decent, it was a little too dry. The chorizo however tasted pretty good, which ended up being the most enjoyable meal. As much as the prices were fair and that the wait and the food was disappointing and not worth the wait, our waiter was very understanding and pleasant. For putting up with the wait and mistakes made, our drinks were on the house which we much appreciated. However, despite the good customer service, we will not likely be coming back here again."

/user_details?userid=geCXXowyO5ZGWnAQsQePpA,Ciril M.,"Philadelphia, PA",3 star rating,"The only reason we stopped by was this place was because Swartz Deli was way too busy for our hungry bellies. We saw this place from across the street and decided to give it a try. When we got inside, we noticed it was a lot smaller than it seemed, like an llusion. The place was dark and had a certain mood, which I thought was cool. The owner or manager brought us to our table and got us some glasses of water. It took a little bit for the waitress to come over with menus and we finally ordered a nacho appetizer with beef. She seemed nice and was able to understand and speak back in English. None of us knew French, so that made it easier for us. It took about 30 mins to get the appetizer. It looked really good. I didn't get a chance to eat all day, so I wanted to dig right into it. However, I wasn't pleased much from it. The beef seemed it was dry, overcooked, and just had no taste whatsoever. The appetizer does come with three dipping sauce sour cream, guacamole, and salsa. Get this dish, but without the beef. We ordered our food, and by this time, the crowded place became just us and another table. That brought hopes to our hearts because we thought our lunch would come out faster, but we still waited another 20-25 minutes to get it. For my dish, I ordered the Chicken Club Sandwich. The sandwich was actually very good. I had a choice to get a salad or fries, so I just stuck with the salad. The salad was normal, and the dressing was interesting. However, the poured so much dressing. The chicken sandwich was juicy and had a little char on the edges. I didn't mind that at all and expected it from reading other reviews. My other friends, all except one, seemed to happy with their orders. The one who didn't enjoy it was upset that what he ordered was totally different. He was too hungry to complain and then have to wait another 30 mins, so he just decided to try it out. He didn't like it and just decided to forget about eating altogether. There was also another shared dish we ordered, which also did not come out. So I'm giving this place a generous 3 out of 5 stars because my dish was tasty and filling."
/user_details?userid=aNfG4yqETNKXNQgc2qTToA,Doris Z.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",4 star rating,"It was a good place to have lunch on st Laurent. They have lunch specials and I got the Cajun fish. The fish was grilled perfectly, it was juicy and tender, I really enjoyed the rice and veggie that came with it. The Cajun seasoning was awesome, just the right amount of salt. The lemon on the side was a nice touch, it really added the citrus flavour and freshness to the dish. However, the service wasn't very good, the waitress seemed to think it is very awkward that I was dining alone. Also, it wasn't very expensive, ~$15 for the fish."

Don't mind if I do order the specialty cocktails. Which was a Sea Breeze (vodka cran), which is a favorite anyway!Cute, friendly bartender and a modern, clean interior. We only had drinks, but experienced a good vibe here. Portuguese restaurant, and I'd have returned if we'd not run out of time on our visit to this fabulous city. Next visit, it's on our list for some delicious Cod!"

You need lots of patience   We waited an hour an half for a chicken club and a few appetizers. My husband got his meal way before I got mine. The sandwich was good once I got it.

/user_details?userid=eQmR6IfPmZ_L4m7CfnIeYw,F J.,"Congers, NY",1 star rating,"Came here to grab some late dinner.  The server seated us and came by with menus.  We were one of two tables who were being served. We put our drink and food order in.  The server came back with drinks in 10 minutes.  We had ordered 3 mojitos which all had no alcohol in it whatsoever.  We waited another 45 minutes for food which came 10 mins later. Wings came out undercooked, burger buns were stale, shrimp patties had no shrimp in them and fries were over cooked.  During the 1 hour + from when we were seated to when we were seated, the server and the bartender were both hitting on a customer at the bar and not focused on getting the food in and cooked properly.  Avoid this place at all costs, you will waste time, money and your patience."

/user_details?userid=anYR2ueFJMNQ3YfsFyHbWA,John W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A solid little Mediterranean restaurant with stylish interior decor and a good summer terrasse. The menu was limited, although it did offer a reasonable variety of options. I had chicken kabobs. The chicken was cooked to a good quality, and the rice was tasty. The salad was fresh, if somewhat plain. My wife had a Greek salad. She found it satisfactory if somewhat pricey ($13).The service was excellent, both speedy and very pleasant. The overall price was very reasonable."

A diverse menu, always with a veggie/vegan option, fish and a game dish(Venison/rabbit/bison, etc) as well as more typical fare.I've been going here since the early '90s. It remains my favourite single restaurent in Montréal, because the menu never gets stale, and the ambiance is friendly and casual."

/user_details?userid=Sd357RRT7uLQ3v52aQaLqw,Jane H.,"Queens, NY",3 star rating,"This is not a place to trek to, however, it is a solid restaurant of the area. The food is good, though the portions are a bit larger than expected. The sangria was strong enough (that is something that is often watered down). The ambiance is dark/romantic, and on a warm day, the open atmosphere is quite nice. Nothing was too memorable, but everything was solid."

/user_details?userid=0e6e1XUquCQVvneyGJ-n5A,Sako C.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Only reason went in this place with friends called a ""restaurant"" was cause Schwarts had a huge line up.Chicken wings tasted like fish.Iga's frozen chicken wings are gourmet chicken wings compared to this place.Took them an hour to bring my friends half chicken ended up being cold,nothing close to portuguese chicken.Should of stayed in have Kraft Diner.Steak Sandwich haaaaa!joke of the century more like rubber sandwich.The hamburger was tasteless and cold,should of walked down on St Laurent for 20 mins have a burger at Burger de Ville.Only reason I gave it a 2 star was cause it was cold outside at least we had a warm place to stay in."
/user_details?userid=2_mSppyp2y08wUTrVPKnNg,Dani S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Poutine Week was my introduction to this resto. The Poutine special was fries with steak and a chorizo gravy topped with a sunny side egg, cheese curds and green onion. It was fabulous! I could have eaten 5 helpings! Instead I split the Poutine and the chicken sandwich paired with salad with my guy! It was a great choice. The only thing this place can do better with is their chairs. They were awkward and uncomfortable, but that wouldn't stop me from coming back for their delicious food!"

Pretty good drinks, and the staff are nice and very informed. The food is great, and presented (plated) very well! The chorizo tastes amazing; and the grilled chicken salad is immense, loaded with avocados, and other fruit (and doesn't leave you feeling lethargic)."

Best choice we made all weekend! We sat at the bar where the owner, Humberto, was our bartender. Talk about awesome customer service! He went out of his way to make sure we had an excellent experience. The homemade deserts were amazing. We throughly enjoyed our appetizers & drinks. If you are in Montreal, you must stop here!"
/user_details?userid=xSr3OFKUnquZFuL_yH5sBA,Eloise T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",2 star rating,"Service was decent, but left a lot to be desired. Although the bartender was kind, he spent more time socializing and doing shots with regulars than paying attention to his other guests. There was a couple next to me who kept trying to flag him down between shots. I wasn't in a hurry so it didn't bother me too much, but it was just somewhat disappointing. He also spent a lot of time talking badly of other coworkers to his regulars. The wine selection was okay. Wouldn't go back- plenty more offered by this city."
/user_details?userid=JZHyl13SBTXeGbQn190jfg,Mario F.,"Hoboken, NJ",3 star rating,I would say 2.5 stars but given good service I went up to 3 stars. Food overall was just ok nothing really amazing about it. My friend did like the grilled squid. I had sangria which was small and not really good. I also had chicken kabobs with rice and salad. It was just not good as what good Portuguese food I'm used to. Service and atmosphere was good and main reason with this rating.
/user_details?userid=QyrV8IXzeCBOqS4Pj2DGUQ,Samantha A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Came here for lunch on a nice sunny day, i was looking for a terrace feeling. The menu is very limited,  with a great location like that on St Lawrence and probably a huge rent i would have developped the menu. The service is very nice. I tried the Chorizo  plate, came with fries and a very boring salad. The Chorizo was good and their fries too. They just need to add a few items on the menu and it will be a very nice spot to go to."
/user_details?userid=iE9HXib1wZu6IeTs5Hkbdg,Joel M.,"New City, NY",1 star rating,"Probably one of the dumbest decision I've ever made. A few friends of mine came in late Friday night for food and drinks. The place was semi empty and that should've given us some hints but they let us in. We ordered drinks and we got drinks with no alcohol in it. They probably thought we were drunk and thought they could've gotten away with it. We didn't say anything initially because they were making our food and didn't want to tamper with it if we complained. The bartender was just chilling with some chick and pretty much didn't care what he was doing. He wasn't even inside the bar during our time here. Food comes out well after 50mins of wait. The waiter said they made the food ""fresh."" Well it was very fresh Alright. My friends wings were nice and raw like the taint you would see on your lucky day. The waiter looked shocked and should've won an Emmy for his performance. My other friend had shrimp cakes that didn't have shrimp in it. The burgers we had were only Okay when we covered it with mustard and Ketchup. In the end we end up paying $130 which included the tip. It was a great hussle."
/user_details?userid=_y8ZGeCGC7pXbDfGh_9N7Q,Mark J.,"New Hyde Park, NY",2 star rating,Do not get the hamburger steak de canard ( basically it's a duck burger). Tasted like liver to me.  I could not finish it and tried to pawn it to others in my party.   Service was descent.  Seemed like others in my party enjoyed their food but not ecstatic.  I tired the steak it was good for not being a streak house.
/user_details?userid=dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,Amanda C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"After walking by this resto probably hundreds of times I finally got to try it out, and I wasn't disappointed. There were a few glitches, but overall it was a delicious meal.My main issue with the evening was that I was with a group. A big (~30 people) group. Perhaps this wasn't the best location for such a huge group, but I wasn't involved in the planning.  We had a reservation so I figured it would be OK. We arrive and realize it isn't huge and we don't see any tables waiting for us. I hope that there is a hidden private room somewhere. Nope. Instead the waitress starts cobbling together tables and chairs from all over the resto. As more people from our group arrive and other diners leave she keeps expanding our area. So we definitely had some interesting table arrangements. Then it took a really long time for us to get drinks, then food, because it was all handled by one waitress (who is awesome and did a great job for just one person).So those issues aside, it was a great dinner. Pitchers of Boreal go over really well! And the food was delicious. They have a list of daily specials that are reasonably priced and varied. The standard menu as well has lots of options at good prices, but isn't so huge you can't decide.  Think portuguese pub food.  Lots of grilled meats and fish and seafood (though the quasi vegan at our table was able to be accommodated just fine).  I had a special combo of liver and shrimps, that came with rice, fries and salad.  My boyfriend had grilled calamari that came with the same sides.  Both were delicious.  I had a HUGE piece of liver, and it was well grilled.  The squid came as one big piece, and wasn't rubbery at all like it sometimes can be.I would definitely pop back into La Cabane, the next time I want to eat a big meal without spending oodles of money, in a laid back atmosphere.  It must be great in the summer when the front windows are open."
/user_details?userid=IbwI369hSb9lkdWPeAYmgw,Justina L.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Great portions for the price you pay. I got the hamburger steak with pepper sauce and the sauce was so good! Especially with fries. The hamburger steak was a bit dry but that's where the sauce helped. The waiter was also really nice as he gave us free amaretto shots at the end ! Sangria could've been a bit sweeter or frutier but that's personal preference

Our server was very kind. She took the time to explain the menu items to us and made us feel welcomed. She also took a moment to explain that in Montreal, you can basically only order beer 3 ways - dark, light, strong. I ordered poutine avec boeuf and it was pretty damn delicious. The others ordered burgers and were pleased with their selections as well."

/user_details?userid=py58LU3dCM6bKL0ygeCWmw,J C.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"I can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed yet!This is a charming bar/pub with Portuguese flair.  They serve local beers, imported wines, and cook up AMAZING chicken dishes (skip the pork souvlaki- this is not a Greek neighborhood, it's little Portugal).  La Cabane is really an unassuming gem.  We were met by a rugged bartender/waiter, a comprehensive menu and specials board, and a great bluesy-rock playlist on a Monday night.  This was enough to stay and eat; the food we devoured was good enough to go back if we're ever in Montreal again.  in addition, I truly enjoyed the spotlight lighting they added to highlight what I'm assuming are the owner's favorite things: the specials board, the beer-brand wall-art, and the collection of Portuguese clay pots on the walls.  Montreal is lucky to have a place like this with such personality.Here's how we found it on a recent trip to Montreal:It's a little embarrassing, but we followed other reviews up to this neighborhood for Rotisserie Romados and were deterred by a few things (lack of seats, stained ceiling tiles, and an all-male clientele that looked a bit perverse eating their chicken).  After all this time searching for unique places to eat, I probably should feel slightly ashamed that I didn't just stick to the plan and enjoy the raved about food, but we fled from Rue Rachel to Blvd St. Laurent... and I'm so glad we did."

I wasn't blown away by it, but I was very happy.

So we jumped off the hop on hop off bus and started our way up St. Laurent, when we arrived to Schwartz's deli there was a line up and frankly my husband and I try to eat healthy so decided we were not going to wait in line for a huge Montreal smoked meat sandwich and poutine which neither of our bodies need.  We made our way across the street and heading down to Ontario street.  Directly across the street from Schwartz deli is the restaurant called La Cabana du Portugal , we wondered into this quaint little restaurant and ordered, I ordered a Greek salad and my husband ordered a grilled chicken sandwich . After ordering I questioned our decision but after receiving it and tasting it I am sold on it.  This is probably the best Greek salad I have ever had with feta cheese and olives in abundance.  The dressing was too die for .  My husband's grilled chicken was moist and tender and flavourful .  Their menu is very diverse and they have daily specials.  I would highly recommend this place ."
