/user_details?userid=wABHp4fGUC-0acRKhmQO2A,Diana X.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"This place is a vintage wonderland. There's the vegan cafe, the gorgeous garden/terrace in the back, and the vintage area strung with all manners of funky knick-knacks. I've never seen a thrift shop like this. There's free popcorn and shots of lemonade as well. It's really an experience to visit, and it feels like a vintage institution in Montreal.I came here mainly to thrift but didn't find anything I liked this time around. I wanted their selection to be larger, but given what they have done with the space the size was probably reasonable. Although I should note their upper floors were closed - maybe there's a lot more to see. It was more the experience that drew me in and left me wanting to re-visit the next time around. I would definitely give the food a try next time - it was tempting to be browsing while taking in the awesome smells wafting from the cafe area."

/user_details?userid=KozoBTm9_mTRxtS7CTl4Ag,Jasmine L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Thrift shop with a super funky & border-line creepy aesthetic! There are 3 floors of super vintage & thrifted clothes, Knick knacks, & homeware that are super neat to shop through. Walking in, they offer free bags of seasoned popcorn and shot glasses of lemonade. If you have a big backpack though, they'll ask you to leave it at their free coat check. On the first-floor they have VERY vintage women's clothing & accessories, a cafe, and an enclosed outdoor patio. The second floor has men's vintage clothes. My favourite was their third floor. It had more modern styles & brands for women's thrifted clothes (ranging from $3-$9), a change room, & interesting houseware & textiles.It was extremely hot in the summer, so not the most comfortable to shop in. But I would definitely revisit Eva B. for a thrift trip!"

It seemed they cater to the hipsters and the rocker guys and gals, if u know what I mean...more punk style stuff.. on entering, we were greeted with a smile and some acv and some fresh popcorn which was awesome..I was looking for some bags but they had very few and I didn't like any. I also wanted to buy a warm ish jacket buy didn't like the ones they have and they did have a few. I bought a thin zipper jacket more like a fashion one and not a warm one at all.paid $20 for it ..too much for a thrift store..they have a cafe too!"

/user_details?userid=mjfkyv8LOi-A6MvC4_G2XA,Claire J.,"El Paso, TX",3 star rating,"This thrift store is so unique and HUGE! there are 3 main levels with mini levels on each floor. You can also purchase little snacks while you shop. However, be prepared to feel overwhelmed here because the store feels never ending. Also, it's very hard to tell if any items are on sale because they are not marked very well. The shoes are probably the most well organized and marked by type. I really appreciated this. As an avid thrifter, I was disappointed to see that the majority of the prices were still extremely ""expensive"" for a thrift store. However, I would say this reflected the quality of the items. The ambiance was just slightly overwhelming. Also, many of the clothes hang on a swinging sort of clothes line. This is so unique and artsy, but it makes it difficult to have a steady hand while searching through the racks.Tip: if you go here, bring more money than you would think to bring, and be ready to spend a lot of time here!"
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Eva B is the strangest and most bizzare store I have ever set foot in in my entire life. And believe me, when it comes to shopping, I've been around, lol. It's a thrift store and looks a little bit like the grungy thrift stores in Kensington Market (Toronto) like Courage My Love and Exile circa early 1990's, but on steroids and psychedelic drugs. The pictures do not do this place justice, you need to see it for yourself. There are mannequins and mannequin parts strewn all over the place, hanging from the ceiling by chains, coming through the ceiling (see pic), jutting out from walls, etc. Some are painted bright colours, some of the mannequin parts are adorned with bondage accessories. There are old vintage sewing machines and parts everywhere too. The place looks like an old garment factory that was taken over by a former circus troupe with hoarding tendencies. Vintage knick knacks everywhere.  There was a giant stuffed bear on a hammock suspended from the ceiling. Chairs from some old theatre. Everything was so random. I did find it a bit funky smelling in there though. The place also has a touch of creepiness to it, at least to me it did. I kept thinking of those CSI shows while I was in the store (you know, where they find a body in the Garment District and then hunt down the killer who turns out to be an eccentric fashion designer and the camera pans out to his private studio and... it looks like the third floor of Eva B?! Lol). As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a friendly staff person who offered me free hot cider and asked me if it was my first time there. I said it was, and she welcomed me and told me the store has 3 storeys and has been around for 30 years. She also offered me free popcorn. The store is full of vintage items and some more modern things too. The clothes selection appeared to me to be ""anything goes."" I saw true quality vintage alongside fast fashion pieces from Zara.  You need a lot of time and patience to sift through everything. And although the place is large, it's crowded because it's very popular. It's also a cafe. They sell drinks, pastries and light meals. The outside does not look like a storefront. Had I not been specifically looking for it by address, I would have assumed it was an abandoned property that graffiti artists got their hands on, and would have walked right by it. There was no sign that I could see. This is probably why I didn't know this place existed while I was living in Montreal (which was way before social media).This place is so unique, unusual, and strange that I have to give it 5 stars!"
/user_details?userid=8h1r7mXd-H225yDgc4EMPg,Sarah A.,"Pawtucket, RI",4 star rating,"This place is just epic! It's a must see even if you have no intention of buying anything as the whole concept, design/ decor is amazing. Lots of good vintage prints abound, there's very cool wall paintings out on the terrace, and there's lots of weirdly posed mannequins that will totally entertain you. Don't miss the giant bathtub filled with stuff animals! The whole experience is just so entertaining. Unfortunately, I never seem to find much in the way of clothing or accessories here, although I did pick up a cool scarf here for only $3 in June. They have a massive selection of scarves, btw, in all colors of the rainbow. I recommend the cafe as a cool, unique place to get a bite to eat and a coffee. The coffee is okay, not the greatest, but it's really about the experience. I've never tried the food. Service is chill although it can be a little slow at times. You could easily spend over an hour browsing around. Don't miss the upstairs and the terrace area. They have both men's and women's items. A must see for any vintage lovers."
/user_details?userid=wvM7vXUZnPCvYYzdYlbV1Q,Katherine H.,"Buffalo, NY",5 star rating,"This cute shop was everything you could dream of for a thrift store. Upon arrival, we were given samples of their tea and smoothies. The rest of the cafe area was located right in front of the door and was just too crowded to order so we continued on. There were so many rooms and floors absolutely jam packed with anything you could imagine. Clothes, book, jewlwey, movies, bags, costumes, shoes, etc. There was an outdoor courtyard with multiple levels that went as high as the three story building. There was even an area inside yo lounge and watch friends. If you are going to Montreal, this is a must-do."

Those cookies are a damn necessity. Seriously. They are by far the best cookies I've ever had in my life. I've literally begged three friends traveling to Montreal to bring them back for me. If i could, I'd travel back to the city for those alone. Don't miss them. Please. For all of our sakes."
/user_details?userid=u0m7Pr6kGLrz09zisl6IFQ,Caroline M.,"Rochester, MI",5 star rating,"This store has been a favorite of mine since I popped in a year ago and realized I stumbled upon a diamond in the rough. It's a beautiful web of organized vintage chaos. I've found vintage dresses , leather pants fox faced flats and so much more. It's the perfect place to find a unique piece or buy supplies for a project. The man who runs the place is very particular about the pieces and everything is in really great condition and sold for very low prices . They have ice cream, coffee, clothes and more. I don't live near Montreal but every time i visit I make sure i stop by! Eva B is without a doubt the most diverse and inexpensive vintage collaboration I've ever experienced ! Definitely worth the trip ;)"
/user_details?userid=rNtfGhTe3h7qFIL46OzbFA,Samantha L.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I'll focus on some of the food for now. The samosas are 1$ each and they are so good. They come with an amazing sweet and spicy sauce. Free water and little bags of popcorn too. Its busy but they are so nice and helpful. They also have a cookie that is $1 and it is amazing! It is the soft and chewy and tastes a little bit like brown sugar with some chocolate on top. Would reccomend just for their food. The clothes are usually in good condition. I got some vintage jean shorts for $20 there and they are super comfy. Even though the shorts may be on the pricier side, they are in good condition and much better than new shorts I could find. Also tax is included!"
/user_details?userid=qtgr1_fvKoMJd4t-naoGqg,Meg A.,"Moretown, VT",5 star rating,"A Montreal institution. My daughter and I were delighted to scour the racks for treasures, after we noshed on the incredible samosas. These were hands-down the best deal of the day. An incredibly generous pocket of fried yumminess with flavorful chutney on the side, for a dollar. Yes, a dollar.  This shop on three floors doubles as a cafe, a very funkalicious one, perfect for a snack. Eva B was exactly what we were looking for in a vintage shopping experience after making the trek up to Mile End and their carefully curated collections (with correspondingly higher prices) at places like Jeans, Jeans, Jeans and Citizen Vintage. Edgy and cool exterior, with a warm and friendly staff, put this place on the map and clearly keep it there. Long may it reign!"
/user_details?userid=Z7xuJ9P_rMtBvi4aFmP7zw,Fouad B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It's a shop that mainly sells vintage clothing. They reworked it lately, and arranged all sections. Noting that in the past you could find anything anywhere and couldn't move easily through aisles, and floors; it looked like an attic; it was packed with miscellaneous objects. Each time I go there I notice that something changed, it is like a living place! It's always a new discovery!There is a coffeeshop, food, books and several small cozy corners and terraces to enjoy your moment!"

The place is loaded with vintage clothes, shoes and accessories as well as interesting pieces here and there from the current. What makes Eva B's unique is that it encapsulates both cafe, shop and haven in one. In addition to clothes, there are ample gidgets and knick knacks to make your heart sing. There are small chicks under a heat lamp on the second level; a couch with a TV that perpetually plays friends and an everlasting garage sale. In fact the whole thing could be one never-ending garage sale. Who wouldn't want that? Anyways go check it out is all I'm saying."

This is one of my favorite (if not my ACTUAL favorite) place in Montréal!"
/user_details?userid=ao7Jt5QoBWO15lGdZH16Kw,Christina T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was never a big fan of thrift shop, something about others wearing someone's else clothes is not something I am comfortable in. The place doesn't wash the clothes but when it is obviously dirty, they will wash it. When you think about it, stores' clothes also got worn by hundred of strangers before someone buy the article...Regardless, the place has a lot of great finds and it takes some extra effort to find the gems. I sold three bags worth of clothes and I got a 30$ back. Since I am a huge foodie, I use 1/3 of my credits on food. The food is homemade and it is very good... I got a plate of dumplings, a pumpkin mashes soup, a chai latte and a bavlava. It came down to 11.30$ with the taxes. With the credit, I had to pay the taxes difference because it doesn't cover it. When you think about it, 1.30$ for a complete set of meals is an amazing deal. Can't beat that anywhere else! After spending about an hour there, I went up the stairs to discover a whole new world. Rooms of clothes, bags and shoes were awaiting me. I didn't expect to buy anything at all since I rarely find anything worth buying but a pearl necklace caught my eyes, then two bags! I spent 18.65$ there in 15 minutes without blinking and I was out with three new things to wear. Good grief... It was quite an experience. I will be coming back to sell more of my clothes and possibly shop there. Maybe the thrift stores ain't so bad after all!"

/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Walking in to Eva B is like walking into a lunatic's head. That being said, it's FANTASTIC! Wacky stuff everywhere you look! I stopped in recently and noticed that they've expanded and are still mid-renovations, and I was with a friend who was in a hurry, so I didn't have time to check out all the new space. Must go back!The first time I discovered Eva B, I couldn't even believe such a place existed. Hanging out of the upstairs window was a Michael Jackson mannequin looking about to drop a baby onto the street below. Everything you could ever want is here. Wigs, costumes, CLOTHES CLOTHES CLOTHES - vintage, gently used, rare items, jewelry, handmade stuff, antique knick knacks, leather for days, shoes, bags, weird things you never knew you could want until you see them. It's a thrifter's dream. I didn't notice if it was still there, but the first time I went there was one room with a clothing mountain, that you had to climb up on with a ladder and you could dig and dig through the mountain and select as much as you wanted, with everything just at $1.It's also a café, with free tasters of apple cider or whatever they have on that day (tea, lemonade, etc) and free popcorn, plus all kinds of treats to buy. I haven't tried the coffee yet. The manner of display is to cram as much as possible into one space, but it's done so creatively and interestingly that you want to spend the time to dig through it all. Plan at least a few hours to be here. I'm pretty sure they hold music gigs here once in a while, too, with part of the space designated as a theatre-type setting. Remember what I said about it being like walking into a lunatic's head? Well, said lunatic is often around - the owner is hilarious, snarky, and definitely a character to experience. I think he liked me, but I wasn't completely sure! Haha! This is an experience of a lifetime in Montreal. Just GO and see for yourself."
/user_details?userid=dAEjpdvaCew-ulyzs2R5CQ,Arianna G.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,Interesting store in that it is a cafe and clothing shop. The food is great and they have an interesting selection of thrifted clothing. Definitely more of a thrift store than a vintage store. There also isn't a lot of space to move around and can get quite crowded. If you are looking for a bite to eat and are willing to spend some time digging through the racks you should check this place out.

As you walk in there's someone stationed by the door to greet you/answer any questions/ check bags (I was traveling with a backpack and needed to leave it as I shopped.) Immediately the music playing seemed to make googly eyes with me then I saw a disco ball and my heart wasn't guarded. Don't worry though, my heart was not broken. For less than $85 I got 2 incredible winter coats which I could hardly tell if they've been worn before or not and seen similar styles for sale in a Free People catalog upwards of $300! Also,  2 scarves, dress, and a rad shawl were on the cheap ticket.Downstairs has a groovy cafe and porch with goods of plenty to explore.

There was food and vinyls and rooms upon rooms upon rooms. An outdoor patio in the back.

Just go, even if you don't buy anything, you won't regret it. If you're thifty and love the hunt, this place is nourishment for your soul. I found an authentic vintage metallica tshirt there for $25 and an embroidered bomber jacket for less than $60 that has become a staple in my wardrobe.

Too expensive for used clothes though a very cool atmosphere, good coffees and lovely store dog."

Make sure you're feeling high-energy if you plan to shop; there's tons of clothes to sort through, the music is bumping, and it was crowded when I went (and it's pretty hot it in there if it's a hot day).If you're feeling more low-key, hang out in *one of several* outdoor patios that are connected to the store!  There are racks of clothes and decor items to browse outside, but you can also park and relax if you like.I really admire that the store owners have such a laissez approach to opening their business up and making it a playful shopping experience."

They did away with the swimming pool of clothes, probably because it became unsanitary and no one wanted to buy clothes out of there. They changed the upstairs, which used to be where they had the more expensive Eva B original creations and stuff from other designers. Now they have a room with costumes and other strange things, and in the next room it's more regular clothes like downstairs. I'm not sure if they moved the original creations downstairs or not. I not clear on what the difference is between the upstairs and downstairs anymore. The service is still friendly, and the place is still unique. I just like the layout better before."

There is a bunch of food at the front that looks good enough, but the place is so dusty, dark, and dirty feeling that despite how hungry I am, I'm never tempted. They give you free popcorn and tea samples when you walk in, which are decent enough but I just don't enjoy eating in an environment like this. You can rent costumes downstairs but the ceiling is extremely low and it smells even worse down there. I went down there this year to browse Halloween costume ideas but very quickly had to come upstairs because I started feeling extremely claustrophobic. I also brought a large bag of clothes here to sell once, most of which were in really good shape. The bag was probably at least 10lbs and for all those good quality clothes, they gave me $5. To be honest, I was quite offended because most of my stuff was definitely nicer than what was on the racks.Anyway, some people really love this place- I feel like it is quite polarizing.

You walk in and are greeted with free lemonade/ice tea and seasoned popcorn.Firstly clothes oh my goodness they have tons of it. You have to dig through piles and racks but hidden gems are scattered all over the store. The layout of the store is incredible with hidden nooks and crannies all over stuffed with vintage goodies, wacky jewellery, and pianos. If i lived here it would probably be the only place i'd ever shop. It's reasonably priced too, with items ranging from $1 tank-tops to $40 suede jackets in perfect condition. While browsing though fabulous vintage finds you feel something brush up against your leg, and when you look down at the worlds friendliest cat and he'll be there begging for a belly rub. While rooting through buckets of $1 jewellery you'll feel a steady breeze against your thigh and a gorgeous golden retriever with be laying under the counter wagging his tail. Can it get any better? (yes)After spending awhile redesigning your entire wardrobe you'll feel a bit peckish and can enjoy a sizeable spicy slice of vegetarian lasagna ($5) and a mountain of a chocolate chip cookie ($1). If you're nice, the eccentric (but awesome) looking owner will throw in a free expresso that comes with brown sugar and a chocolate drop. And lastly, my absolute favourite thing is the decor. It's like everything cool in this universe was found and tacked up somewhere in the store from severed doll hands to broken clocks. They have a massive library in the back and a closet full of vinyls. This place is every hipsters (and teenaged girl's) wet dream."

And detailed the situation to whomever he was talking to on the phone.  All in all a very nice store however, I believe that this man needs to more explicitly clarify what is for sale and what is the price for each item.P.S. A woman came up to the counter while I was making my purchase and wanted to buy a number of frames, one of which was marked 5 and the others were unmarked. When she asked the price this same man told her one of them was 15 and the other was too important to him he would only sell it for a ""price that would scare her""."

The only thing I wouldn't touch is the food (although I heard it's good) simply because I'm paranoid about places covered in dust that serve samosas that lie out in the same place people flick their dirty clothes about. Other than that though, Eva B is the place to go - just to say you went! The prices are decent for the items, I saw a lovely yellow trench coat, lined, winter-worthy and all for $40. It was really a rare yellow color - mustard and lemon mix. Bras hang from the ceiling (wouldn't buy those though), and this insane $1 pile where all you do is take off your shoes and DIG. I'm sure that if you find something there it would be worth it, just depends if you have the time to scrounge through.It's definitely more of a feminine feel through out the place. But you can see the mind of pop culture genius working throughout the decor. When I went for Christmas, they had a naivety scene with Harry Potter as Jesus, Hitler as the fther, a Bratz doll as Mary and naked Barbies as the Three Kings. GOODNESS! Outside the store... dun dun dun Michael Jackson holding his precious baby.The store is a general mess.

Kind of like the ball room at IKEA for adult thrift junkies.-While shopping I was offered some raspberry iced tea in a vintage glass. It was tasty and much appreciated.-There was an old guy with a white beard cooking something in the front window. I think corn on the cob-In the men's section there is a pet bunny-if you go out the back there is some sort of overgrown garden-The prices are very reasonable and they sell both vintage and new clothes-there is an anarchist bookstore in the same block, and a vacant lot where I saw what I thought was a squirrel, but it turned out to be a rat!"

The place is decorated kitchily on the outside, so not hard to find. Once you step inside, it's a madhouse of stuff everywhere. Now, they must be decorated somewhat for Halloween, but I can't imagine it's much different from their usual look. It's mostly women's clothes, jeans, shoes. They have a few dressing rooms with mirrors on the outside of the doors across from a mess of handbags. I found a polka dotted Le Chateau blouse, but cut way too deep to wear to work. I found a pair of awesome flared jeans for $7, but the waist was too big and I didn't like the empty backside without anything including pockets. I found a pair of tough black wedge combat boots for $15 CND, but not sure whether I could really pull off the girly dress/tough boots combo at my professional conservative workplace so I left them alone. In the back is a men's corner where my partner found 2 shirts for less than $18 CND and I ogled over the bunnies. There are lots of jewelry - mostly plastic, loud necklaces, rings. There was a bin of hats, too. Off to the right of the store is the notorious $1 bin. It really is like a giant ball room., about 10 ft x 8 ft, except filled with clothes. With the recent bed bug scare in NYC and BOS, I was not stepping in, just in case.I saw samosas at the counter for $1, yum!  So it's a thrift store-cafe, they buy clothes (""You look better naked""), accepts credit cards, sales people generally leave you be.

The $1 pile makes me crawl in my skin, but that's just me.  I snagged a nice pleather moto jacket for $10 and had fun sifting around all of the little odd'n'ends. This place is my kind of jam."

I stumbled upon it 2 years ago on a trip, and went back 2 more times before the trip was over! I basically got a whole new wardrobe. I love the treats you get when you go in! I cannot wait to go back again this summer! MUST STOP!"
/user_details?userid=D2Mqwt4Yp21SJwZVvBN1Ag,Pea J.,"Detroit, MI",5 star rating,i am soo overwhelmed with this place... its funky you can always find classy or camp or costume... i was in Montreal for the jazz festival and went every day for cappuccino and shopping. i got a boatload  of jewelry enough to last me until next year... and clothes but the draw of the place is julie and crew and the young old man.... you are missing something if you dont stop here even if you live in town!

/user_details?userid=xEzPJcx5Ny6NLm0p974dJA,Dorise H.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"my new favorite store!  it's one of the hippest used/vintage/consignment stores i've ever seen.  the best part is swimming through the sea of hanging bras, or perhaps just finding cool unique but still totally affordable clothing you can't find anywhere else.  they also took my US $$ and didn't charge me tax on my adorable $5 top, they pour complimentary lemonade and iced tea to beat the heat, and the lady was pretty darn cool. my favorite store in montreal by far!"
