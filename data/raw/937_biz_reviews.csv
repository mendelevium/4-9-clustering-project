/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"If you're visiting Montreal and you want to find a really local place, then this is the place to go.It's mostly popular with an older crowd and sport fans because you can watch your favorite sport and have a cold one whether it's summer or winter.I would give it more stars if it wasn't for their selection of beers, they have only some Canadian beers and few imported. Unlike other pubs, I wasn't impressed with their limited variety of beers."
/user_details?userid=-Xqi1rcvaYQsyY6YTDKUfA,Mike Z.,"Wayne, NJ",5 star rating,"Awesome local bar. Friendly staff and customers. The location is great as it's near many good restaurants, which makes the bar a nice place to meet friends prior to going to a restaurant."
/user_details?userid=RTkJZZMNQbAEoCfxapcRLQ,Aella M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"C'est une bonne place pour voir le match de d'hockey. Les personnes sont chaleureux et majorité francophone. La variété de bière est minimum, mais  mes amis ont dit que ils étaient satisfaits. Il y a une quartier de l'orange sur le pichet.  L'ambiance est cool et le moment qu'on est arrivés les canadiens ont commencés à gagner, alors l'énergie est très positive."
