The only choice I have in this restaurant is the spanakopita plate which comes with potatoes, rice and salad, since I am a pescatarian. For a lunch dish, it's super huge, and usually I eat the salad for supper. For a massive dish, it's not expensive at all. It's super tasty but little dry for me. The marathon salad is so so delicious with their marathon salad dressing. I wish they would have some fish and seafood dishes, so I can try different varieties."

Very easy and quick! The lady was very sweet and made sure to get our order placed efficiently. She even gave us an estimate of how long the order would take to get ready! Pretty quick 10 min wait and boom it was ready!Food: this is one of the better marathons, the plate was jammed packed ! My donner pita was SHTUFFED with tons of flavour It was filled to the rim of the pita with tons of pork and beef shavings and Tzatziki !!! Wowowow I was in Heaven! By far one of the better donner pitas I've had! Super fresh and delicious ! Salad was super fresh as well And don't worry about the price vs quality, you will not hit the bank when you come here very affordable quick and delicious ! Overall, pretty impressed with the service food and overall quality totally recommend !"

Everything was so flavorful and scrumptious!Their pita breads were to fluffy and heavenly, I wish I wasn't back in the states.Most people, would probably be overwhelmed by the amount of I believe it's called, tzatziki sauce on my meal, but I felt like I was in heaven, with every bite!The little appetizer platter we got was delicious as well!"
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is solid visit to visit, and they've got their routine down pat.I've been there several times for lunch meetings (other times with family and/or friends for lunch or dinner) and despite it being a bit on the loud side, they have a nice lunch menu --- fairly priced and service is quite prompt. The portions are substantial and quality is consistent on. The taste is also very Marathon, and in some ways is a bit boring seasoning wise, but then again they probably go with what the majority likes and keeps coming back for, as they are usually on the busy side.I was pleasantly surprised that they had several hot tea flavor options and that they ask if you want onions on your salad. Garlic is another story, as the garlic bread that comes pre-meal is full of it, but it's yum and that's what mints are for...All-in-all it's closer to a 5* - but in my case, I prefer bolder flavoring."

/user_details?userid=sVV3wstSWCBdqVwK5AzqHw,Nisreen K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"A little bit of attention goes a long way and this where marathon lost its 2 stars. I called to make an order to pick up and was very specific in my request. I even asked her to repeat the order. Once I got there I repeated my order and she handed me the bags. I presumed since her sole job was to handle take out orders that I didn't need to check my order. Well, big mistake. Once I got home I realized the order was incorrect. I had asked for one stick plate with salad and two other souvlaki pita plates with rice and potatoes. I got 3 salads and one plate of rice and potatoes. I had also asked for extra tzatziki for which I paid 3$ and it was also missing. When I called back she told me she'd give me a free plate next time I'm there which is great but how are you going to make my crappy dinner experience better today? Needless to say that was one sad meal."

I always order a Doner plate,  when I  tell the waiter, half fries and half rice, he responds back by saying, ""NO PROBLEM"", not like some other greedy restaurants that charge extra, this  is why this place is doing fantastic business. Prices are fair, and the service is excellent. Keep up the good work!"
/user_details?userid=b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,Jim P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I used to eat here somewhat regularly for lunch (maybe a few times every few months) when I worked in the area but since working downtown, I haven't been back here in a few years.I had a craving for a good souvlaki pita or gyro and since I was in the general vicinity, I decided to revisit this place for dinner. In the past, I had gone here for lunch but rarely if ever came here for dinner.When I showed up (~6pm on a Friday), the place was somewhat crowded  but I was seated immediately. I was shown a table and given a menu.Since I already knew what I wanted to have, I looked at the menu briefly just to look at the prices and when the server came back to my table, I informed him that I would like the Souvlaki Pita Plate which came with either a Greek salad or a Marathon salad (I opted for Greek) and fries or rice or half/half (I opted for half/half). The server mentioned that the souvlaki pita is pork and whether I had any issues with that. I informed him that I didn't. I asked for the tzatziki sauce which normally is generously put in the souvlaki pita to be placed on the side and the server mentioned it wouldn't be a problem. I opted for this since too much tzatziki would give me problems so I wanted to be in control of how much tzatziki was in my souvlaki. Since there was a minor discount on the price of a second souvlaki pita, I opted for this.Someone passed by and placed some garlic buttered toast/bread on my table and gave me a glass of water while I waited for my meal. I tried the toast and thought it was very good.My plate didn't take long to arrive and I thought that it was quite a lot of food. The fries were waffle type fries and they were okay/good. The rice was okay/good. The Greek salad was good. The tomatoes could have been a little less ""soggy"" or ""mushy"" but it was still good in my opinion. I'm not a fan of feta cheese but the piece of feta cheese included with my salad was good/okay for feta cheese.I thought that the souvlaki was very good. I put a bit of tzatziki in it from the small container where my ""tzatziki on the side"" was place. I would say that it was better than the soulvaki offered at the Souvlaki Bar on Cote Vertu and might be on-par with what is offered at the Souvlaki Bar at Montreal's Central Station's food court.The server passed by a few times to refill my water without me asking which was great. When I finished my plate, he passed by and asked me if I wanted a coffee or dessert. I mentioned that I was full and fine. He passed by a few minutes with my bill, a piece of candy/mint and the portable card machine. I paid and finished my glass of water before leaving.I would rank this place as 4.5 stars which I've rounded up to 5 stars."

But I can't say the same for the food I found the pita was a bit chewy, chicken was very good, there's a lot of dry pieces of rice all over that was little weird. But overall it was pretty good."
/user_details?userid=UoE2BDcztaO4tY5AagwSlA,Ed H.,"Riviere-des-Prairies—Pointe-aux-Trembles, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Let me tell you about Greek food if you haven't had it. It's pretty neat. Lots of fresh ingredients with an equal amount of cooked things like rice, pork, chicken, squid, yadda. Basically at no point will you ever have anything overwhelmingly undercooked or overcooked at the same time on the same plate. It's light, good to binge on and it ends up making you feel all right in the end.So we went to this place, Marathon for a family dinner and the atmosphere is basically like an Applebees meets Mediterranean food, which was like a mindfreak of itself, but I guess if you're going for not offending anyone it's the proper approach. Like get some cool Greek stuff in there. Pictures of Athens, decor to match the dishes, cutlery from Greece. Something to denote that this is a great place with people from the culture cooking there.They start you with ""garlic"" bread. I tend not to pick on garlic bread but this was so under spiced with garlic, I could only taste butter, which in my experience as a Slavic guy, this makes it buterbrod, not garlic, but who knows, nobody asks Slavs their opinions on shit like this. The food was awesome. I forget what everyone else got, but I don't really care about their opinions since I'm the one reviewing. I got the Calamari. Came with a side of rice, and a Mediterranean salad, though you could choose the house salad (for those who can't handle eating Greek at a Greek restaurant) and fries (for the even more bland of personality) if you so wanted. Gotta say, the meal was great, though I took most of it home. Look, my baba doesn't even feed me this much food. I do not need 2 kilos of calamari, a kilo of rice and a kilo of salad, though for 21 dollars, it's worth it.Also they were out of Greek beer, which really bummed me out cause I miss Mythos, but I can't really blame them for that, can I? Yeah I can. And do. Get your Mythos back in stock. I need some. Yesterday.Oh and I forget her name but our server was hilarious and basically became my mother in law's best friend in 15 minutes which is not an easy feat. Props to that. All in all, it's worth a stop, just don't expect anything highly traditional if that is what you're looking for. It's mostly for olds and people on a budget to have good food cooked fast and to have a decent outing, to which it accomplishes. If you're looking for something straight out of the peninsula, you'll be saddened, especially if Mythos is on backorder (caulisse de tabarnak...) but it'll scratch the itch you need to get the flavors you're looking for."

The souvlaki there is gyro, chicken or pork.""""Wait 'til we get to Montreal,"" I said ""a real souvlaki is made with lamb.

Further complaints: industrial tasting taramousalada served with white bread--chewy pita extra.I guess you can't go home again. I don't think there were other options--chicken, pork, gyro (gyro!!?) for souvlaki back then. The great Greek restaurants of the 60s and 70s are tasteless chains now--Arahova, Casa Greque. They buy the name and good will but lose the personal touches that make a restaurant great.Montrealers please message me with the name of a Greek restaurant that makes a real Souvlaki. I'm sure they are there."

The first time, earlier in the lockdown, I figured it was due to undercooking the chicken and I let it slide. The second time, which was more recently, I ordered for two people and we both agreed that the quality has diminished. We fed the chicken to the dog. I suspect Marathon is using a new subpar chicken supplier. I won't be going back."

/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Marathon is usually one of my favourite restos but I find this location falls short. I came here with my family for lunch today and we were all a bit disappointed. The lunch specials are great and super filling. I had a souvlaki pita with marathon salad. I love the dressing they use on the salads and they are generous with the feta. Unfortunately everyone's meals came out luke warm. I've found this to be a consistant problem at this location. The atmosphere is nice, I get very nostalgic here since I've been going to the one in the west island since I was little and the decor is pretty much the same. Overall, I find this location to be inferior in quality and service to the west island one so I will probably drive a little further to the other location when I get a tzatziki craving!"

My coworkers brought me because I had never tried Greek food before.I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the souvlaki pita and it was served with a side of salad and rice. You can also opt for potatoes fries instead of the rice. The portion was a bit big for me, but I probably would have finished it if I didn't have to worry about food coma in the afternoon.Since it was my first time, I don't have anything else to compare it to, but I enjoyed the food. The service was quick, and the server was nice. They gave us garlic bread, which was soft and crispy. Once we finished, they gave us another basket of them, although we didn't eat it considering our main meal was a big portion."
/user_details?userid=ZWD8UH1T7QXQr0Eq-mcWYg,Jason G.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,Being in Montreal so many times I've come to realize that Montreal has soooo many Greek Restaurants.  Lets add Marathon to the list of Greek placed I've tried in Montreal.  I ordered the lamb chops.  The portions were huge and the lamb was marinated and cooked to perfection.  My only issue with Marathon was how tight the tables were.  I little more space would have been nice.  Over all a 4.5 star experience.

Marathon Souvlaki was all that and more, we had the Souvlaki chicken plate and the tzatziki dip. I would have preferred pita bread with my dip (it's available separately- but realized a bit too late)The chicken was flavorful and tender, the rice was cooked well and the fries were quite more like thick crisps. The portions at this place are rather large so I would suggest share a plate between 2 if you aren't starving. Didn't like the ambience as much but the food really makes up for all that. Our server wasn't very pleasant, but the food made up for that as well. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants good Greek food."

They've got good food,  pretty decent prices. Let's face it: it ain't sophisticated cuisine, pretty simple and to the point but Marathon doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is. ***A recent reno job on the interior spruced the place up some."

We have been to every Greek restuarant you can think of in Michigan...everyone.None of them can even come close to what is available in Montreal, even though these are chain restaurants they are great.The porc souvlaki is out of this world, the frites and the rice are wonderful as well as the salad. Everything here has taste, everything in the states is so bland. On the other hand refills are free, all drinks come with ice, and a large is a large. Here glasses are small, there still trying to figure out what ice is and you do not get free refills. But the food is incredible."

Our first time was okay, but didn't blow us away. This time was slightly better, but still only worth 3 stars for me. The place itself is set up well for groups of all sizes, feels clean and even has a couple TVs playing whatever sports is of the moment. I ordered the souvlaki stick plate, which came with rice and a Greek salad. The souvlaki was great, and I preferred it this way as opposed to inside of a pita (which is how I had it previously). The rice was also surprisingly good. The salad was like, an afterthought. In fact, maybe they were trying to get rid of their tomatoes because the salad was literally overflowing with them. Not the best balance for a salad. Anyways, I wouldn't go out of my way, but if I was in the neighborhood and I wanted something on the healthier side, I'd consider stopping in."

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I've been here a few times and let me tell you this Greek restaurant does not disappoint!! This place is always packed. The fried calamari is good and the tzatziki as well. I like that they give garlic bread at every table even though I try not to carb up. I usually get the lamb with rice and fries and the marathon salad which is basically Greek salad but with lettuce added. Sometimes I get get the souvlaki pita which is also good but I really like the lamb. The portions are big and the price is right. I always get the red house wine... it's surprisingly good! Its a nice resto to go wit your family or a group. It's not very romantic so I wouldn't say it's a good date place but if it's a casual date I say go for it!

/user_details?userid=N0LfSpP4RNS9t3GwIcuNxA,Hope P.,"Hollywood, FL",4 star rating,"Got take out from Marathon and ordered pitas to go I was near the airport and the Yelp Rating was thumbs up.  I had the gyro (beef/pork mix), the meat was shaved, tender and perfectly seasoned. My fiancé got the souvlaki pita platter which has pork off a skewer and I just prefer shaved meat consistency.  The tatziki sauce was plentiful it had a good creamy-cucumbery flavor some red onion slices, tomatoes, and the pita soft and chewy.  The rice had diced carrots in it and it came with a side salad too to complete the platter. Salad is iceberg, I don't consider iceberg a nutritional salad in my book, but it had a Greek creamy-vinaigrette tasty (maybe not homemade since I saw the ""fries""come from a previously frozen bag), tomatoes, cucumbers, white onion slices, nice chunk of feta cheese, and A Single Olive on top.I was very happy with the food quality and would try it again when in the mood for Greek."

The waiter on that night was the one requesting me whether I needed something and proceeded to get it done on the go.Food was not bad. The establishment is not cheap --we had enough meat for two for under 30$. For instance , the calamari plate was not the best , but it was good and not oily , this is a big plus as you don't feel completely drained and dead after your meal. The souvlaki pitas had enough meat and plenty of sauce for one to be satisfied. Their fries tasted like potatoes chips cooked in the oven--so goood. As for the Greek salad , wasn't great but it wasn't bad.Anyway , I felt like the reviews for the restaurant did not do justice. Indeed, marathon souvlaki is an excellent restaurant with Greek specialities, if is affordable and you feel like a customer that they want you to come back for another visit , which I personally will."

Food tastes OK, its does a great job at satisfying my once in a while gyros cravings. I suggest the gyros plate, its their most popular and comes with rice/fries and choice of their house salad/greek salad. The house salad is great, and the ingredients were fresh, I wish I had some more to compensate with the guilty meal! Their little medallion fries used to be crispy and mushy on the inside, but I was disappointed for my visit this time. They turned out tasting bland and almost cold. Hopefully I get lucky with a fresher batch next time around. Moreover, I find the pita to be a little on the chewy side; do make sure to take reasonable bites ;). Also another tip for the ladies, I wouldn't recommend ordering the pitas for first dates, as it can get a little bit too messy to eat (unless you're a confident clumsy eater of course!).Price is slightly high considering it's very similar to food court food. But you do pay for what you get (service and dine-in). It's still very affordable. Service was great, informative and fast. Thanks!All in all, I will be returning!"

BUT the last 2 times I came I found it disappointing in a few different areas. Service wasn't horrible but was a little slow considering the restaurant wasn't overly full and didn't really come by the table to check on us we usually had to flag them down, a few details that would have made the experience better. The food was also not great the last two visits -gyro meat was oily yet dry at the same time , rice was hard and the tzatziki was just ok. This was very disappointing considering that this isn't the level of quality that I'm used to from marathon. I'm hoping this was a rough patch or bad luck because I used to really enjoy coming here. Im sure I'll go back because I would be willing to give this place another chance considering the fact that I've had much better experiences here than the last two and I'll do so with the hope of being able to update this review with an upgraded rating !"

Oddly, I like most things on the menu but food was just ok.I really think Marathon's is over hyped.I've been here twice and ordered the chicken brochette plate, called ""chicken stick"" on their menu, for 11.45$I found the chicken dry and chewy. It was like eating plain chicken breast.I've tried their pitas before and just not a fan of the tzatziki sauce. Overpowering, smelly.Rice is very good, and salad is alright - as another reviewer mentioned, its just iceberg lettuce.The bread basket they serve everyone is trying to pass off as garlic bread, but they use oil, not butter. It's gross.The best thing on my dish was the feta cheese, really."
/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I would really rate this restaurant a 3.5/5 but I'll kick it up to a 4 since we generally do take-out and don't have to eat there. They have your usual variety of Greek dishes: hot and cold appetizers, souvlaki, and pitas. Depending on my mood I get chicken souvlaki pitas, the fried calamari, or maybe a pikilia plate if I want a bit of this n' that.  It might sound odd, but one of my favorite things there is the taramasalata dip; which is one of the best versions I've had. Otherwise I'd say it's pretty solid fare, I happen to like their tzatziki because it's thicker which suggests it's made with strained Greek yogurt.It's always busy here so even when you phone in ahead of time for take-out you might have to wait a bit to get your order."

/user_details?userid=v5HZqSBEUJpL9pASSINg2g,Gurjit K.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Marathon at any location either In Laval or Montreal they are really good and the food is just too delicious  so delicious that I have to restraint myself! But seriously worth to go try and warning, you will get addicted. They serve Greek beer and other choice of soft drinks. House salad really good along with their French fries. My favourite is the the Doner plate! Thus, you won't regret it."
/user_details?userid=z4XWk_7z19jB7JFO1g0R6A,Josh S.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Very good service at Marathon, located by Baton Rouge. The beef gyro was tasty, made relatively quickly, and was fresh. The Greek salad was good too. It's rare to find hot sauce in Canada other than Tabasco, so that'd be a nice addition. But this is a place to get food quickly, that's not fast food"
/user_details?userid=JArO1E1pr1OJlIh-E2SweA,Melissa Y.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"If I could eat here every day, I would! This place is great for comfort food. The portions are huge and the prices are great. I always go for the souvlaki pita plate because it's so good. I once had the fried calamari, but it was only ok... The garlic bread that they serve at the beginning of your meal is also really good, but it seems like the bread was better a few years back than it was now.This restaurant is always packed, so try to get there early if you want to avoid the wait. The service is surprisingly fast even when the place is full."
/user_details?userid=FuW1EwnbQoHyDMeOGrljsg,Khanh L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"the service here is lighting fast!!!If i grade with service it's 4 stars, but I only do the food so 3 stars.We came, we ordered, we ate, and we left all within 25 minutes!!!The fried calamari is standard taste wise, it hit the spot, except it comes with cocktail sauce and not tartar sauce, and no lemon wedge.The doner pita/gyro. The tzatziki sauce is a bit mild for me i would have liked more salt and tang. The doner meat was very good though fresh and juicy.Definitely recommend this place for a quick eat, there's always a lineup but it moves very fast.very nice I like it very much"
/user_details?userid=t3E47Ed0w-31q0QY6TGHMw,Miranda C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Simple, delicious Greek food for a great price. They specialize in typical Greek food (souvlaki, doner), and do it right.Bottom line: if you're looking for some sort of super trendy and modern restaurant, Marathon's isn't it. If you're looking for a casual Greek restaurant that's consistently good, fresh, and fairly priced, then I'd highly recommend paying Marathon a visit."

/user_details?userid=Reo3OZKzqTdwdSyOphXiMQ,IQ C.,"Manhattan, NY",3 star rating,"Good place for large group but food was okay.  The lamb chops were fatty and gyro dry.  Their fresh fries were the best part of the meal!  Baklava was old, hard and chewy.  Not worth the $4!"
/user_details?userid=pFYYCrKbAM5Ryf1-dvFGNw,Meghan B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I seriously love it here. The food was great, huge portions, and it was really cheap. It was $30 for my partner and I to share a starter and each get a plate with a pita, salad, and fries which also came with a drink. You also get this delicious garlic bread at the start. Neither of us could finish, there was way too much. It was really noisy, and the pittas were a bit heavy on the tatziki, but it was oh so good."

I consider this place as the Montreal equivalent to Paramount.  We had the Gyro's with fries and I must say, that was the best Gyro I ever had!  The meat was juicy and not salty. It had the right amount of veggies and sauce. The fries come in a round shape and taste fresh and crispy. I definitely recommend!"
/user_details?userid=ZfIDArNjrfsQwcsDHeMZmg,John A.,"Issaquah, WA",4 star rating,"Marathon Souvlaki seems to be a locally owned souvlaki restaurant with only a few locations.  This Marathon is located in a shopping center near the Montreal hippodrome, among a Baton Rouge, Roots and Stitches...off of Decarie.The food is a good value.  They have options of chicken or pork souvlaki, gyros, doner meat, etc. You can get one or two of each, or a combination plate with your choice of two items from a series of selections.  Along with your meat choice, you have the option of rice or fries and a greek or marathon salad.  They also have merguez sausages and calamari available.  The portions are large, and the average price is $15 per person.  Along with your meal, you will get free garlic bread.Every time we go, the service is nice (for Montreal).  My only complaint is that they don't come around enough to offer refills on water.If you are in the area and hungry, or if you are looking for a good souvlaki restaurant, you need to go here, it's really good!"

The food is always tasty and fresh, the Tzatziki is one of the best I have ever had and I think their salad dressing is made with crack (no matter how full you are, you always go back for more). I LOVE this place"

And the biggest compliment that I can them is that the food is incredibly consistent. There's never a surprise. You get what you expect every single time. Best souvlaki in the montreal area. Don't let the amateurs tell you differently. You can take your Marvins, Village Grec, and Arahova and stick em where the sun don't shine because that's where they belong."

/user_details?userid=LknZlzFAS6Fkbe69g5J1Zw,Kat C.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,"Very good (both locations I've tried... Des jockeys and des sources). Service ranges from super friendly to curt and a bit impolite. But overall, good enough that I return often. Food is consistent. Well oiled machine. You go in knowing what you'll get. That's important because no one likes being disappointed. They have a fairly small menu and that helps keep consistent plates coming out of this bustling place. It's noisy. It's packed. It's not a date place. It's just good, reasonably priced Greek food. I always order the veggie pitas and even my carnivore friends agree it is so well put together and tasty that they don't miss the meat. Dip your fries in tzaziki and you're a happy person."
/user_details?userid=SIhK7M284uH9n2VXLW63cg,Steve S.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",1 star rating,Had the fried zucchini which was drenched in oil. They were uneatable. The feta cheese tasted like cardboard. There is no way this is even cheese. The souvlaki in a pita was decent. The restaurant was a complete mess. The restaurant was maybe 20% full but there was food everywhere on the floor. You think the half dozen or so of waiters would have cleaned up a bit.

Not a taste twister, but definitely decent drop-in location if you are hungry.Friendly, quick and useful service. They even speak English and are not pissed if you do - a huge bonus around Montreal area.The food was very good! Big portions, excellent quality. Not a high-end restaurant level with custom food, but something absolutely decent and eatable.Overall, I would compare Marathon to a Red Lobster in its better days. Type of food is different, but you know what I mean. :-)"
