Definitely a little hidden gem and very reasonably priced. The service was a little slow but we were a big group. I had there vegetable tempura. It was so fresh and delicious definitely did not regret getting it! By the time my main dish came I was pretty full but still had my noodles in a spicy miso. Again so good! Everyone in our group loved everything. I will definitely be coming back, so many more things to try."
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"First time trying out YEN. Sushi was ok but I kind of expected a bit more. The tuna nigiri pieces were a bit odd, there were extra stuff that they should've probably trimmed off the tuna because they couldn't be chewed without a knife!"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"A new discovery near Concordia! I love their innovative menu and meal presentation, and of course it also tastes amazing. I've been here twice now and I've tried their tartare, avocado, and soba noodles. They don't disappoint. I really recommend the avocado tartare as an entree and the chicken miso soba noodles. Those were my favourite meals of theirs so far.What I like about their noodles is they serve the broth in a teapot on the side so you pour at your leisure."

From the neon signs at the entrance to the colorful sake bottles lining the walls, YEN Cuisine Japonaise definitely knows how to decorage its interior to make everything look cozy and inviting. We went there last night for dinner, and took two tables in the back. The menu was beautifully illustrated, and the food seemed delicious. I got the Gyu Toshikoshi Soba, and my friends got the Hotatedon, Oyakodon and Gyudon, amongst others. The food took quite a while to come (~40 min). The food looked beautiful and the dinnerware was very neat. The broth for the soba was served in a teapot, which was an interesting touch. Taste wise, things were a bit less exciting. Flavors were good but did not keep my attention for very long. The Hotatedon, in particular, was overtaken by katsuobushi while the scallops were thin and discreet, hiding under the roe.We overall had a good time, but not so much because of the food."

This spot is really informal and the menu is extensive; I opted for the tartare in avocado, as well as  their miso noodle soup with teriyaki chicken. Both dishes were super yummy, but the soba noodles (made in-house) were exceptional! The soup comes with a separate kettle full of warm broth so you can always top up as you go; love! Although the service was a little off, as the dishes were not being served all at once, we still managed to alll catch up wIth our mains so the diner ended perfectly! I would definitely return to try some if their rice bowls and more of those delicious noodles!"

We had a reservation at 8pm and restaurant closed at 9 but they let us stay without any problems until about 11pm. One downside is that my friend had ordered an appetizer and a meal and the meal came so late everyone was almost done theirs. The food presentation is great for photos, very colorful.  I had the kaisen barachirashi which was a sort of poke bowl but with a lot of lettuce.  Taste was good, a little on the bland side but i liked it, nothing wow.  Also had the home sake (hot) which was also good.I tried one of the sushi (can't remember the name) but it was on a fried salmon skin. I didn't really like it as it was very fishy.A friend had one of the soba bowl and the noodles were overcooked.  Also didn't have much taste as he kept on adding and adding soy sauce and spices.Another friend had the foie gras sushi and she mentioned it was delicious.I guess it's a hit and miss depending on what you take."
/user_details?userid=E2oq_BwdQmq_Vyte65icNg,Emeline V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"YEN is hidden under La Panthere Verte and under another Japanese restaurant so it's easy to miss, but that would be a shame. The place is so cozy and charming: the walls are wooden beams, the light is soft..They have the most beautiful menus, printed with a black background and lush images. I am a sucker for wakame and of course ordered the entree: it was fresh and delicious served with a little roe. I had shrimp tempura and soba which was so good I saved some for later. My date had the duck and soba dish and that duck was so tasty I would recommend it in a heartbeat. They have some dessert (matcha creme brulee and something else) but sadly I haven't tried them...yet! YEN is such a cute place for a date! Date or not, I will be back!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious food, convenient location and great service. We had the takowasabi, kaisen barachirashi and the soba noodles. They were all fresh and delicious. The takowasabi had a strong wasabi taste, perfect for congested nose. The kaisen chirashi was very fresh and the sauce was perfect with the combo of avocado and raw fish. The soba were nice and the soup was comforting. It cost us around 20$ per person. The service was great. The waiter was friendly and has a nice smile. The place had a nice deco and is clean. Would definitely come back."
/user_details?userid=LiD311vn_95gf_IJYjrjuA,Dawei L.,"Quebec City, Canada",5 star rating,"As I wondered around Concordia, I came across this beautiful place with food that made me felt like a 5 years old eating my favorite dish made by world's best mom! Although a bit pricey, but it's definitly worth every penny.I was astonished by its deliciousness that I forgot to remember the name of the dish I ordered. Please look at picture underneath for reference.It was a hot and tender soba clearly made from the heart and soul of the chef. On top of it, was a fried teriyaki chicken fried to perfection. The chicken was crunchy yet tender from the inside.  It came with a small portion of salad that I'm sure was from costco (not a complaint, I love costco products hehe). My supper also came with a spicy salmon miso soup that I forgot to take a picture!!! What a crime from my part. I gotta say, one of the best miso soup. I would drink it everyday as my entre if I could! Overall, like the terminator once said ""I'll be back""."
/user_details?userid=GQGvCTi2SvL9U_d3fsm9Tw,Stan C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ah, the thrill of a new discovery!!This discrete new Japanese restaurant serves Soba noodles the likes of which I have never experienced. These were prepared in Dashi and some mystical ingredients that made them smoky and sweet and enticing.Atop this mound of slippery Soba goodness was a healthy serving of duck slices - perfectly cooked, toothsome and juicy alongside a delicate handful of greens.  All the flavours complemented each other, playing nice and not competing for superiority.  Superbe!For dessert I tried the black sesame Crème Brulée. It was tasty, and different to my palate, but the fusion of oriental and occidental cuisines remained harmonious.It being a month old (the restaurant, not the Crème) and that fall term classes haven't started yet it was underpopulated. Do not expect that to be the case come September. This place should be hopping!"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I was looking up Japanese restaurants in Montreal and stumbled upon this one. A friend had also mentioned it to me but we both hadn't been here yet. Instead of going to the actual restaurant I saw that YEN delivers on Uber Eats. Being sick and lazy, my boyfriend and I decided to order in on a Friday night. Boy am I glad we did! It was delicious!! The food would probably be even better at the restaurant because it would be more fresh and just the right temperature. I will definitely be back!We ordered four things from the menu but the restaurant messed up and only made two out of the four things. We had to call them back and they made us order a soup so that they could add the other two dishes to our order. They refunded us the soup but since they messed up and we had to wait another 40 minutes for our food I felt like they should have made it up to us like maybe give us a free appetizer or dessert or something. Technically we got the soup for free but it was a simple miso soup and honestly I took one sip and threw it out. It was way too salty. I love foie gras so I basically got everything from the menu with foie gras!! We ordered the foie gras salad. It's so not healthy but damn that salad was tasty! The salad was your typical leafy green salad but with four pieces of foie gras in it and sesame. Not sure what the dressing was made out of but I liked it. We also ordered the grilled duck breast with soba noodles and creamy sesame sauce (Kamo Goma Soba). We wanted the green tea buckwheat soba noodles but unfortunately they ran out. There were four pieces of duck breast with noodles and salad. I was surprised that the salad was there. My boyfriend and I shared both plates and in the end I ended up mixing both the foie gras salad and soba noodles together which paired well together and there was already salad in the soba noodles anyway.Then we waited about 40 min for our order. We ordered the nigiri moriawase which I highly recommend. It comes with 6 nigiri: salmon, blue fin tuna, foie gras, scallop, BBQ eel and shrimp tempura. Everything was so good!! The shrimp tempura nigiri was probably the least impressive and the one I enjoyed least but it was still good. We also ordered the foie gras Uramaki roll. This was also delicious!! The inside of the roll contained tamago (Japanese omelette) and avocado and the outside of the roll was salmon with a piece of foie gras on top and roe (fish eggs). I will definitely go to the restaurant and I will definitely order delivery again because even though they messed up our order the food exceeded my expectations!"
/user_details?userid=grGjIaojBJf04jwK0VRiOA,Kevin J.,"Dorval, Canada",5 star rating,Very good Japanese food! I ordered a tenzaru soba and they gave a very generous portion of tempura and the soba was made perfectly!Price is decent for a japanese restaurant and a lot of varieties of dishes.I would definitely go back
/user_details?userid=pq8hKpl-FSbTihJJWx0UQw,Lily L.,"Brossard, Canada",2 star rating,"So I don't know if the restaurant had paid influencers or not for such high ratings, as I came here with very high expectations but left with a bad taste in my mouth. First impression, great deco, they def cater to the Instagram dinners. With the lights shining on the table for gréât pictures. Then it pretty much went downhill after. I should really have paid attention to the many previous reviews about bad service. It was one of the worst ones I have experienced in a long time....I'm talking in years. And I go out to eat almost every week.We ordered three items, the salmon and foie gras roll 20$, salmon on rice with broth 11$ and salmon roe and sea urchin soba for 18$. (I'm rounding off/up to the dollar amount before tax) The rice and soba came first. Both dishes required mixing which I did. The soba had zero taste, no sauce....and when the waitress came asking how is the food, I told her bluntly it taste bad, as it's totally bland. She came back with the house sauce....which was a salad sauce....not soba. So I requested the dish to be returned. A manager or senior waiter came and started saying if I wanted to return the dish I should have returned it right away, not before I ate all the sea urchin and roe.....I told him, I mixed it not ate it. Then I processed to find him the three pieces of the sea urchin (the dish only comes with three pieces) and all the salmon roe that was just covered under the noodles. He then proceeded to tell me that I shouldn't have mixed it.....at this point I'm like...are you crazy.....the dish is suppose to be mixed.....then he told me that soba is like this, bland......that's how we make it here. So I said well if you choose to be different from all the other Japanese restos here in how you make soba and make it bland, please warn me when I asked you about the sobe before I was ordering the meal. So I was adamant I'm returning the meal...all these time my sushi still didn't come. I had enough and asked for the bill. They removed the soba but still charged me for the sushi which never arrived and I had to ask to get my corrected bill again. Overall...I'm sure it's a mutual feeling that Neither parties want me to come to this place again."

/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I think this can be my two hours drive to and from once a week worth it place! I am not usually a nigiri person but ordered their nigiri moriawase because it looked so good! Let's just say that I wanted to turn around, go back in and order another set of nigiri! Also, do not think that it's expensive there because there are no prices listed on the menu in their site. It is very affordable! The only issue that I have, and it's not a big one, is that they only serve sake, shoju and beer. So no wine. Probably make it a Friday thing lol"

/user_details?userid=rRKRIBTKW8IrkJsF53DonA,Ryan K.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a pretty solid Japanese restaurant in Montreal. They have quite the extensive menu, with lots of variety and thankfully many options for me as I don't eat seafood or fish! I started with the Renkon Age (lotus chips)...probably falls in the category of ""I bet you can't eat just one"". Then I tried the Gyu Tataki Soba. I really enjoyed it. Presentations of food were really nice too.The restaurant itself has a great decor. The service was great as well. Definitely would be back."
/user_details?userid=8VROonanfM3k3XgCXPzQHw,Lulu C.,"Potomac, MD",5 star rating,"The food is very authentic and the dishes are very well made! It took a little long for the food to come out but if you can wait, the food is worth it. We got the Kaisen oshi tartare, samon ochazuke, samon teriyaki soba, and ebi tempura soba, and they were all so good and aesthetically pleasing! I would definitely come back, because it's sometimes hard to find authentic and good Japanese food, but this place exceeds my expectations with how traditional yet unique it is."
/user_details?userid=7Cj3RJblijlbbLdmlak3pQ,Eric M.,"Burlington, VT",2 star rating,I am shocked by the high reviews here.  Maki roll was dry and flavorless and nigiri was chewy.   I was unable to eat any of my scallop nigiri as it tasted like it was just thawed from the freezer.   No sushi bar and the ambiance is cheap feeling.   Luckily I started with only a few pieces and one roll so I was able to leave and eat elsewhere.   I left about half of what I ordered on the table.

The food is very good and flavorful. I ordered a lot of raw fish and it wasn't smelly. It was F R E S H!This is the place where I'd go eat and hangout."

Ordered the followings:Maguro Carpaccio: Really nice, fish was quite fresh, I highly recommend it. The spicy sauce isn't really spicy, will try the house sauce next time.Soba Noodles with Tempura: The tempura were nice and crunchy. Soba had a good bite and the sauce that came with the dish was pretty good too.Salmon Foie Gras Roll: Really tasty. It is a must! The foie gras simply brings everything together.Gyu Roll: Good shit. It would be nice if they offered a version with wagyu instead of regular beef.We had a good service. The waiter explained the menu to us and was really nice. Will come back for sure!"

/user_details?userid=GbDfPbqp7gKRwbn116KDSA,Ben K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"With the closures of Isakaya on Parc and Azuma on St-Laurent, I've been on the hunt for a replacement. This review should be read with that in mind.The food here is good, and I was certainly swayed by all the 5 star reviews into coming here. But like Tri Express, what someone loves will always find its detractors. I feel like those grumpy old muppets on the balcony.I came for lunch and stuck mostly to maki and a few starters. The raw octopus had a nice little bit of crunch to accompany a rather offputting sliminess to the dish. The sweetness of the dressing matched the cloying sweetness of the iced tea: overdone, and perhaps in need of additional acidity. The salmon tataki was to match my experience with the maki in the rest of the meal: over drenched in the same sweet sauce, and masking the flavour of the fish.So the disclaimer is this. I don't mind a bit of avocado, drizzle of a bit of sweet teriyaki-type sauce, mayonnaise in my sushi. But it seems to be de rigeur to put it on everything.The service here is friendly and attentive, and the decor is pleasant enough. I'm just really fussy with Japanese food, and so this is a sincere 3.5/5 ""it's better than ok, but not really to my taste"" rating."

/user_details?userid=fskl2Zyc3o38S5HFtXjFDQ,Sean D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2 star rating,"Do not go to this restaurant on a busy night of the week (Friday or Saturday). They have 1-2 people serving a packed restaurant. Yes, the food is good but when you're getting one dish or roll of sushi every 10 mins it's hard to enjoy. Sat there for 1.5 hours on a Saturday night in a group of 5 and ate 4 pieces of sushi, one seaweed salad and 4 pieces of sashimi. There were a number of dishes we were waiting for but decided to cancel them and just get out of there. Steer clear of this place if you're not a couple unless you have 3-4 hours to kill."

/user_details?userid=Dncd29gQOGt8iNmLW7Nv9g,A C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",5 star rating,I admit we actually meant to go into the ramen joint upstairs...ooops. Didnt have the heart to leave as the young waiter/owner was so attentive and friendly.  And they just opened a month ago.  So glad we stayed! The dishes were all delicious. The teriyaki chicken was nothing like the stuff in the US.  It was this delicious hybrid with a katsu.  Thinly crispy without being bready.  Sauce was not too sweet or syrupy.  The scallop roll was yummy. Kids wanted another one.  And Snugs slurped down his duck soup soba.  Wish the place the best!
/user_details?userid=rEK1Qb9ApWjQd1919I5PxQ,Samil T.,"Edison, NJ",4 star rating,"This relatively new joint is surprisingly well endowed with a friendly staff and a refreshing variety of Japanese dishes. Set in a minimalist atmosphere, this a great place to stop by if you're in the mood to have a nice, relaxing meal. They highly praise their rice, which comes in thick grains and is very satisfying to the last bite. My favorite entrée is their duck broth, which I conveniently ordered with some light and refreshing green tea noodles. If you can handle the smell of duck, this dish is absolutely wonderful. If you are more conservative with your pallet, their chicken teriyaki is smaller in portion, but not too sweet and extremely satisfying as well. In addition, I highly recommend their genmaicha green tea as it has toasted rice inside and has a robust after taste."
