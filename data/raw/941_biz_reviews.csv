It was pretty busy every morning but we really enjoyed being there. The best part was seeing people with their dogs... super cute dogs! Aside from coffee they also have amazing pastries. Muffins, croissants, cookies, and some danishes. The place has lots if natural light and plants and it's small and cozy. It's on a great spot right next to other shops and restaurants."
/user_details?userid=YUlBxBTPMPM3mawg4Opuvw,Haque I.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It's a nice little cafe right around Atwater Market. I went there since I was in that area and was looking for a study spot. It was packed with people in the morning and the whole cafe has this nice aroma of coffee that welcomes you as soon as you step inside. One extra bonus is that they allow dogs inside and even if you don't have a dog you get to pet dogs when someone stops by with their dogs :) it was something lovely in the middle of studies :) The latte was strong and I would say the coffee quality was on the top 15 percentile of all the cafes I have been to in Montreal. The only downside for me was that it was pretty noisy and it was hard to concentrate on studies. But again maybe it's just a great place to have great coffee and hanging out with friends - not for quiet study session. Also given that there are very few cafes in Montreal that allows dog inside, this place deserves an extra star! Would definitely go back!"

I thought they would have great coffee but sadly enough their lattes were nothing exceptional- froth and coffee itself. Something for them to work on perhaps to improve the froth and pick a better coffee brand. The tables are extremely cramped which made it less enjoyable. I am glad I can cross it off my list."
/user_details?userid=bQCHF5rn5lMI9c5kEwCaNA,Vincent L.,"Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"A somewhat petite but nevertheless pleasant cafe near Atwater Market and Lionel-Groulx station. The coffee drinks and the baked goods here are quite satisfying and not unreasonably priced, and overall it's a nice, cozy venue at which to read the paper, get some work done, or just have a sip while in the neighborhood. It's also dog-friendly, although I wish owners would keep their dogs on a leash at all times so that they don't traipse freely around and disturb humans otherwise minding their own business or get into kerfuffles with other dogs."

And the fact that your four-legged furry friend is welcome to sit in the warm café at your feet and chill, or make new friends is great. Mais les cafés eux-mêmes était très, très ordinaire, malgré qu'ils ont été fait devant nous, par un barista enjoué, était froids, pas beaucoup de saveur. Maybe it was just a bad batch of coffee, maybe the ""machina""'s température gauge was faulty but definitely NOT worth the price!"
/user_details?userid=uGvwnTYKZ9IzRTtMTwTlJA,Adrien S.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of the absolute best coffees in Montreal. If I'm in the area, I always make a little detour to get one there. The staff is friendly and the place is quite nice, though very small so seating depends on time of day.But worth trying out if you're around the Atwater market."
/user_details?userid=zbMWWUh3RWieIcatxELdew,Wendy W.,"San Diego, CA",4 star rating,We enjoyed our perfect almond milk lattes with a delicious muffin! It was a bonus that dogs are welcome inside this cafe. We brought our dog's inside to sit by us too!
/user_details?userid=tFga4vd_Fb_h4QrxBPRAiQ,Ana Paula S.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Favourite cafe in Montreal. Dog friendly and relatively  quiet enough for work. Definitely recommend the grilled cheeses, pastries (from Chez Fred I think), and lemon bars!"
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"As I am into cafe crawl montreal, I spot this coffee shop while I am walking on Notre Dame street. The name of this cafe caught my attention. I meet up my sister and tell her... let's try this place. I come back here. It's a very small space, but has a cozy feeling. The service is friendly, but it was long, since there is only one person working. My cappuccino was good, but I had better. Plus, it has free wifi... whooo whooo..."
/user_details?userid=0goB-Irbm8GGFsPcobs39Q,Olivia S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Adorable little neighbourhood café on Notre-Dame St. The service was very attentive and welcoming and the music was excellent. I definitely recommend this place to meet up with a friend or to study. The atmosphere is so chill and cozy.
/user_details?userid=6AsvRrPTd_OXWkAIwqKjEQ,Honest R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I LOVEEE that their ice coffee drinks (cold brew, latté, etc) has ice that is frozen coffee (instead of water) so that your drink is not watered down as the ice melts. Phenomenal - bang for your buck!! More places should do that, esp since some cafés load a drink with way too much ice. This café also closes late so you can actually work into the evening and their wifi is great! In addition, I love the dog-friendly atmosphere. The only aspect where I had to minus points was that the cups they use to serve hot drinks do not have a handle; it makes it inconvenient to hold in your hand due to the heat. Hot beverages belong in a mug with a handle!!!!"
/user_details?userid=cntYY9TAsK8gLccAVmLK9Q,Joanie M.,"Granby, Canada",4 star rating,Excelent coffeeThe mocha is delicious! I can't wait to try the latte and cappuccinos. I think the vienoiseries come from a place not far. They are very fluffy and tasty.
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Location: East of Atwater, on Notre-Dame. The closest subway is Lionel-Groulx (Orange) and it's less than a 10-minute walk from there. Street parking is available - both metered and not. There are certain streets that are not zoned where you can park without paying.The place: It's not much bigger than their previous location but the layout is better. The decor is more urban and 'clean', if you will. Very simple, no bells and whistles. I do miss the other location's funky furniture as I think it added charm and a unique style, but what can you do? I do find the lighting to be a little dim. One of my favourite things about Lili & Oli is the music: 80s alternative. LOVE IT. The goods: I've ordered an almond milk latte both times I've stopped in, and they were both enjoyable. Service: Well, the barista is still a little surly and smiling is not his forte but again, what can you do. He makes some decent coffee and that's why I go there.Price point: $4 for the latte - I don't think there is an extra charge for the almond milk but I'm not 100% sure."

/user_details?userid=WtmmtVkui7AjVIZvnqQHwg,Rosie B.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"TLDR: Quiet atmosphere and good coffee.The barista was very sweet and had great suggestions. I had their mint tea and an almond milk latte which were quite enjoyable. It seems like a very good place to get some work done, as everyone around us was working and were quite studious. They also have Fous de L'ile, which is not an easy find.Definitely, a nice calm cafe to visit."
/user_details?userid=DRmLwsrsr-TgghISHXz09Q,Helena R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Come by this coffee shop at least once a month and it's a 1 hour walk from my place. Amazing staff, always smiley and welcoming, good selection of teas and excellent music always.If you like butter, the croissant is pretty much butter in the shape of a bun, so decadent and delicious!I don't usually drink coffee, but I have friends who love their cappuccinos or a cup of hot chocolate.Cozy, warm, very Montrealy! ;)"
/user_details?userid=TFWj1wQh21k5jFlK-u_sxA,Yola M.,"West Orange, NJ",4 star rating,"4.5- My boyfriend and I were visiting from New Jersey and Lili and Oli was conveniently down the block from where we were staying for the weekend. It's perfect for an on the run cup of coffee as well as to sit down. We settled in, ordered cappuccinos and a croissant from the barista, and spoke to a few locals who were welcoming and helped us start our last day in Montréal on a good note. I'm very picky with my espresso drinks and their cappuccino has the right balance of roast intensity and frothy milk.Unfortunately, they didn't convert our US dollar to CA dollar and they only take cash. Besides that, awesome spot!"

/user_details?userid=SLrkSbmHZkMjj2gRXOjKFg,Barry Z.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"My favourite latte/capp. in Montreal, and in my top 2 cafes (along with Pikolo).The few times I was here, the espresso had a deeper, richer taste than in a lot of other shops i.e. more Italian, which is what I prefer. Every time, my milk drink was well made. If you haven't been here, you should check it out."

/user_details?userid=r3ZOsLoGgl8X3bYAWwx1SA,Steph B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Happened to walk by this place and decided to order a latte. Was a little unorganized trying to order as it is set up like a bar so there isn't really a place to stand in line.My latte was delicious though so it made up for the confusion.downside to this cafe is that they only take cash.
