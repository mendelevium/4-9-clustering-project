I'm American but my family is originally from Cuba. We tried the croquettes, Ropa Vieja, Cuban Sandwich.... all were excellent but what really took the cake was a dish called ""Bandeja Paisa."" It's a mix of different foods... to die for.I will definitely be visiting this place again when I'm back in Montreal. Leave room for the Flan with Queso!"

Coming from Miami (and being Cubans) we have eaten at many Cuban restaurants so we know that it was authentic delicious Cuban food. The service was great also!Nuestro grupo visitó de Miami en junio 2019.  Nos encantó la comida, pues era auténtica comida cubana!  Lo podemos recomendar 100%.Muy buenos precios y excelente servicio también.Muchas gracias.  Pasamos tremendo rato ahí con ustedes.Daniel"
