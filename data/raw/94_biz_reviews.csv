I haven't been to one pita place where the beef wasn't dry, here it's tender and flavourful. Overall the texture is really nice with the tzatziki sauce.So is the Pitarifique poutine - just a great combination of toppings without being pretentious. Decently priced, lots of different meats available.A neighborhood staple, that's for sure."
/user_details?userid=Hyebr-zLlbCYc5Q5ztJJUA,Kim Y.,"Braintree, MA",5 star rating,Besides their food being amazing. I forgot my purse at the restaurant and they went above and beyond to make sure I got my purse back. They were able to obtain my phone number and then text me to let me know I had forgot it. Thank you so much for your kindness and of course for a full and happy tummy. Will definitely recommend to friends!

I had a sandwich made with chicken shawarma. It was messy but super tasty!But one star off for the lousy takeaway packing. No styrofoam please!"
/user_details?userid=gjB4ORFO2LDOOSjS5wuTGw,Katie F.,"Miami, FL",4 star rating,So glad I heeded Yelp reviews and stopped in here while my boyfriend and I were visiting the area. We were pretty hungry and decided to share the Pitarifique Poutine which was absolutely delicious and loaded on with tasty soulvaki. You can definitely tell this a local spot for students and others alike. The platters looked delicious and huge as well but we weren't hungry enough to get one though I will say everything looked plentiful for the price asked! IG: @KFitzEats
/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is super low key but really cheap and delicious. I've had their philly cheesesteak and pitarifique poutines and both are awesome and huge with tons of toppings. Souvlaki was also surprising good, really tender and juicy meat. A plus is that it's such a casual takeout-y restaurant but they serve beer (also for cheap)! It's maybe not the ambiance for a first date, but for a 758th date with your partner of several years It's perfect."
/user_details?userid=LPDOx50zUR-rEovzOhADbA,Rachel C.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"Staying up late to write a paper? Come to Pitarifique. Had a long night out at the club and working up an appetite? Slide by Pitarifique. Just hungry and craving a cheap and delicious meal? Go to Pitarifique! My regular order flip flops between the cheeseburger and the pita souvlaki and I ALWAYS get onion rings. The cheeseburger is flavorful and is so good with a dab of tzatziki. The pita souvlaki is to die for, the meat is soooo tender and well seasoned. And the onion rings? Wow. To die for. They're always served fresh and are the perfect level of crunchiness."

A neighborhood staple for about 13 years now, this is a family business with consistant high quality excellent food. The fries are to die for, all of the poutine are great. Excellent chicken slouvaki and Greek salad. Perfect view out to St Laurent and a great place to sit at such a central corner. I've never been disappointed and I've been going the whole time.  Totally a step above every other place that's similar. Often super busy. Open late and you can have a draft beer too. Don't miss it."

Swatrzs is here, a great store la Vieille Europe-some great murals. Then bypass the tourist spots and go to this unassuming place. Poutines that are really well done, and great platters and sandwiches. Cheap delicious eats!"

/user_details?userid=mBuhgyQ6Wix-1CKMJHbQag,Jennifer H.,"Johnson City, TN",5 star rating,"During my visit to Montreal, I had a single thought in my mind...""must try poutine""I tried to go to the more known place across the street, but it was small and cramped and the service seemed non-existent.  I looked out the window and saw Pitarifique was fairly empty and had tables so we made the switch.I ordered the small veggie poutine and I'm so glad I did.  The small was huge.As far as the taste, I'm no poutine expert, but this was amazing.  I couldn't get enough of all the flavors blended together from the gravy and cheese and veggies.  For a first poutine experience, I definitely picked right."
/user_details?userid=R9Cx2rilFJe-K_DQ5i2EAA,Ashley H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Way better and much cleaner than Patati! The only thing Patati conquers in my opinion are their French fries.
/user_details?userid=HgCv2lm-GuACRanD7bSqyA,Eric T.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"On a recent trip to Montreal, I had a lot difficulty trying to find both Patati Patata and Pitarifique, both eateries that are located just on opposite sides of St-Laurant. I could never easily locate them whenever I got out of Mont Royal station. So thanks to a photography tour group on a Saturday, I was finally able to come across these two places and after unwinding in my hotel room, headed back here for an evening meal and my main focus was the poutine. Since both places are withing close proximity of each other, when the first choice had a short line-up at the door, I was able to come to the second place where I could see the inside between the shoulders of people who were eating there.I just got a Cheese Burger and Regular Poutine Combo that a choice of Root Beer as my drink. I'll say that the both the burger and poutine hit home, especially the poutine because the gravy on it stayed at a pretty almost hot temperature when I finishing up my burger. That really helped get my poutine fix on my last evening in the city. Thank you Pitarifique!Plus, the fact that it wasn't crowded inside also allowed me to get a good view of the inside while I was eating my meal. Plus, a film on(maybe it was The Godfather) so that added up with the entertainment factor.I'll definitely come back here if I'm ever back in Montreal."

Honestly I didn't think the food would be good but it exceeded my expectation tremendously. Presentation, looked a bit messy and difficult to eat, but the taste was great!! I'd Def reccomend and come back myself"
/user_details?userid=HpzMECWPO4H1fJihiMG1Pg,Lanyi L.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,I love this place!! My roommates and I came here for a late night munch one night and it was so good that we had to go back for lunch later that week! All the pitas are delicious! The meat is tender and juicy and there are generous amounts of vegetables. And the saucessss oh goddddd. Good price too and great customer service. They also have TVs with a movie playing and I always find that so therapeutic when I'm sitting down to eat. Would eat here again and again!

/user_details?userid=RWsMnb4BLWQWtqb9ciflYQ,Annie C.,"L'Île-Bizard, Canada",1 star rating,Ordered by uber eats.. took over 30 mins and the food was super cold. I feel like the salads were taken out of someone else's plate and put into ours... all the veggies were wrinkly. We ordered two wraps and they were both soggy and gross. I don't understand how this place has such good review. Definitely will not order from there again.

The fries leave something to be desired, though, so if you're looking for a poutine, you might consider somewhere else.Definitely worth a try: philly cheese steak, veggie sub, chicken pita, or gyro pita."

/user_details?userid=gVIg5YIIx44tz4fTzvVdlQ,Des T.,"Quebec City, Canada",4 star rating,"Came to this place for lunch one day, looking for something good, comforting, cheap and fast and I got it... I ordered the gyro wrap with just a drink and it was very filling!A couple of things that would have made my experience better... 1. I was asked if I wanted ""everything"" in my pita... It was my first time there so I didn't know what ""everything"" included... Listing the filling options for the customer would definitely show more attention to detail. 2. When I got there the place where all the empty plates are placed was overflowing. It definitely needed some tlc... 3. And lastly... this might sound funny but I don't like their exterior signage! lol... am I the only one who finds it hard to read in the daytime... red letters on wooden panels?! Simple white lettering with a black outline would have sufficed! Or not... I'm no expert, just visually challenged I guess.I don't mean for any of the above to come off as negative comments, I would definitely return to this place and if you're in the area you should check it out too."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I ordered the Pita Gyro Authentic, which includes a mix of all three meats available plus tzatziki sauce as well as tomatoes, lettuce, and onions. For what it was, it was pretty good - especially for the price. Would I come back again? Probably not, considering that it was just like your average cheaply-made gyro, but it was definitely a better experience than other sandwich places like *whispers* Joe's Panini."

I got the souvlaki plate, which was a little heavy, but tasty overall. Looking forward to trying the myriad other fast-food type options on the menu. Service is fast and efficient. Go here if you want to spend less than ten dollars, eat something in abundance which is a cut above normal fast food, and be served quickly."
/user_details?userid=TyRRSckAsEKbqDoXG5n1nQ,Michella L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because they forgot my extra sauce I ordered. But the souvlaki is great , chicken gyro better than Arahova! And the plate I had last night was delicious! The fries have spices on them so no fry goes uneaten , and the salad they give is aways nice not gross like other delivery.This place is not fancy but it is ALL around great spot for what it is ... Oh and not to expensive considering the prices of delivery these days."
/user_details?userid=jxcXExWgrObwx5AL8-LMbA,Nazim A.,"Downtown, Canada",5 star rating,"Pitarifique is fast efficient little restaurant with all your typical Montreal fast food options (pizza, poutine, pita, subs etc).  Food is made right in front of you and served just the way you like it.

/user_details?userid=5C_Eu1Bo8y0MEBBKa9iqYg,John C.,"Saint Louis, MO",5 star rating,"I lived in Montréal for two years and this was by a wide margin my favorite place for poutine. The poutine toppings are cooked wonderfully and the portions are very generous - I'm a big guy and I'm unable to finish a large by myself. Go with a friend and split a large. You can even get beer! The TVs usually have some sort of soccer match, and they're open late night, which makes for some great people watching."
/user_details?userid=r7GHYNcXMwCxd5SIHNBsAQ,Valerie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ye!!!! finally something new to talk about! It has been a while since I have discovered anything new worthy of reviewing, but now it is with pleasure that I shout out my new favorite steak sandwich place.  The cost is 10 dollars for a large (which is easily 2 "" foot longs""), and in our last order we tried the cheeseburger at 4$. So now we know it is cheap, but is it good?  Well the hubby said his burger was good, but the reason for this review is the Philly Cheese steak sub, I am now addicted!  The bread is warm and fresh, the meat is flavorful and juicy, the lettuce shredded perfectly, and a nice big piece of  tomato....is your mouth watering yet, mine is..., not sure what the cheese was and it doesn't matter because it is melted into the goodness, and finally a perfect garlic mayo  that just takes it to the next level.  I will highly recommend them, I will be a regular customer, and I am thrilled to share and get the word out.FYI I have been not yet stepped foot inside as I have had these loveley morsels delivered by someone else, but I will be checking it out to see what other gems they have in store on the menu."

We tried the Greek salad, pizza poutine, philly steak poutine, and a gyro plate. We shared this among the 7 of us and we could have fed 5 more people!  The main guy at the counter was cool too. He gave us some tips on being in Montreal. I also loved that they served draft beer here too."

Their food is incredible, the prices are reasonable and the service is exceptional. BONUS: if you're craving a souvlaki platter or their Montreal-famous Philly Cheese Steak, but don't want to trek out to them, their delivery service is super speedy. I've been coming here since it opened, and don't see an end to this in sight."

Their delivery is pretty fast, as well."
/user_details?userid=BvucnTI64sumNCKhTgHTWw,Curtis D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"By far my favourite ""fast food"" place. Their pitas are great. They don't skimp on anything, I've had most things on their menu.  My personal favourites are the double bacon cheeseburger and the chicken Slovaki. The only slightly disappointment are the fries (which are only ok) and the 14"" subs (which are only two 7"" subs) which are pretty minor given that the food is delicious. If you are looking for quick meal and a great bang for the buck, eat here!!"

No matter what you tip he will ask for more, so start with nothing on your order and tip whatever is actually fair at the door, or less since he provides the worst service.

/user_details?userid=mHEuZHVHszZAhDYRHHqmBA,Joe C.,"Farmington, CT",4 star rating,"Pitarifique Magnifique!I went to this place 3 times in 4 days (yes too much red meat to go with too much alcohol), and it was worth it each time.  I was completely blown away that Montreal had this corner shop that was never packed, but should have been.I can only comment on the burgers as that is all I had.The burgers are absolutely delicious, and whether you get 1 or 2 patties, add bacon and/or cheese...the quality doesn't change. I got the bacon cheeseburger, a double bacon cheeseburger, and a hamburger (not all at once!).  Granted, the double was wayyyyyyy too much food for me, I was able to save it for later.  They are big patties and the buns are fantastic and, while it's kind of greasy, it's not enough to make it soggy like you'd get at 5 guys or something.  The fries are crispy and delicious, and you can turn it into poutine, which isn't that bad either.They have either tap soda or you can pay $1.35 extra and get a Stewarts glass bottle soda - the obvious choice.  The atmosphere is more take-outish than eat-inish, but there are a few tables and stools where you can eat and enjoy watching people walk by. You can watch them make all your food, the gyro meat is cut off the spit like you're in an authentic greek shop, and if you get the item you want ""all dressed,"" it comes with lettuce, tomato, onions, hot peppers, pickles, and ketchup with their special sauce.  By the way, the special sauce is spectacular!I got a bacon cheeseburger trio (fries + drink - I substituted Stewarts +$1.35) for about $8.50.  You can't beat the price for the quality in Montreal, let alone anywhere else.If you're in the Montreal area and are going down St. Laurent toward Mont Royal, it's on the corner of Rue Rachel and St. Laurent across from Patati Patata.  You can't miss it, and you absolutely should not miss it!"

/user_details?userid=aYL7qtwOMdzYayaddq_Hnw,CT M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Declining Quality. Misogynistic Service.I've been eating in and ordering from here sine it opened (see old review from 2011 below), and everything thing about this place has been on the steady decline for months now.Delivery is now only available from Foodora, with a $4.50 delivery fee (separate from tip).The subs have have gone from gargantuan to lacking enough ingredients to count as a full meal.The fries taste as thought he oil doesn't get changed for days on end.And the last time my GF went in to grab some take-out while I waited outside, she (1) had to listen to the staff degrade women and their intelligence while they cooked, (2) was forgotten about *after they took her order and she had paid for it, and (3) was then derided for inquiring about her order when the cooks went back to standing around complaining about women some more.*****[OLD REVIEW FROM 2011]The biggest problem with Pitarifique is knowing what to order. If you like good, mom-and-pop greasy spoon, you'll probably like everything on the menu.The menu can be broken down into about four different things: burgers, subs, pitas, and greek-style plates.The burgers are all around solid, whether you get a single, a double, or either with bacon or cheese. Their subs are everything a greasy spoon sub should be: very generous but not so greasy that the bread turns to mush.The pitas are pretty much souvlaki inspired, coming in either grilled chicken or gyros, and served with a generous portion of tzatziki sauce, and wrapped in a thick, fresh greek-style pita.And the plates, well, I've never had one, but I figure that if everything else is a 4/5, then they can't be all that bad, either.The atmosphere is very greasy spoon, though, and space is very limited, so I'd recommend either getting it to do or calling for delivery."

Their pitas are tasty as well, I'm a big fan of their tzatziki sauce.

The pita I got was beef, I meant to order the Gyro which is the traditional beef and lamb and it looks like the one in the picture but I was so damn hungry I forgot. I got a side of onion rings instead of fries as a test to see if it was on the menu because it was good or just on the menu but no one ever orders it, yes I trick these places to get the best reviews for my faithful friends online at Yelp. The pita bread was soft and thick more like a greek pita you get at a restaurant, grilled and soft. There was beef steak, not just small chopped up steak and the lettuce was shredded and tasted fresh. The key to this was the Tzatziki sauce, tangy, thick, not runny and not salty, just cool flavor. I wanted to eat another one right after I finished but got it to go and realized that I was in the living room after inhaling the pita with no regards to my surroundings, it was that good. I would like to thank the owner and the pita guy too, they were super chill and friendly, not that the place was shady, but it literally is a hole in the wall that you pass by while saying ""another shishtouk place"" woohoo. You actually will be saying woo f$^%ing hoo after having one of these bad boys."
