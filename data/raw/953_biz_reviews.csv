/user_details?userid=P_n7r_z0AL8uBUjk5ErEsw,Pierre L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Torino is a very good restaurant if you are looking for an affordable Mediterranean food. You can choose from a good variety of side dishes. The staff is very friendly and the food is always fresh with the meet been grilled as you order. The chicken is delicious and so is their potatoes. Their fattoush salad is also very tasty. After visiting 3 different locations I came to the conclusion that the quality of the food and the friendliness of the staff varies greatly from place to place. I find that the experiences I had In Laval (carrefour Laval shopping centre) is significantly inferior to the ones downtown Montreal (square Victoria).They also have deliveries through just-eat.

The quality, portion, and selection are great. I usually get the grilled chicken, the grilled steak, the hummus, the garlic spread, the grilled veggies. All delicious!"

In spite of  the quantity of food courts in downtown, good places for quick lunch are still limited. Cost-quality is fairly reasonable. A good choice for people working in downtown. Have a try!"
/user_details?userid=KUzSS0uiCIlQIcJT63pjGw,Carlito B.,"La Salle, Canada",5 star rating,This place has great food with amazing service. Just step up to the counter and they will be glad to let you sample their chicken. I usually go for the mixed plate that includes a filet mignon kebab and a chicken kebab with your choice of 3 sides. Top that off with hummus and garlic sauce and your good to go. Fairly priced for the quality you get. The downtown location is very fast and accurate considering the crazy lunch line ups. The Brossard location has an amazing staff that is always smiling and super welcoming.

/user_details?userid=8IiPX3tSK9-bv4Ucr433Zw,Liquid R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This used to truly feature some of the highest-quality food and best values you could find in a food court in all of Montreal.  The staff were friendly, got to know you, and served generous helpings of grilled chicken, beef and sides that potentially even sourced you leftovers, depending on your appetite, for under $10.Alas, there seems to have been an ownership change a little over a year or so ago (the original staff is all gone, at any rate), and the quality has now slipped a fair bit on all of the sides (salads feature cheaper ingredients, sauces are blander than they used to be), while the volume of food they give you has been curtailed dramatically - the full grilled chicken breast was cut back to thinner cross-sections of a full chicken breast, or worse, strips of even smaller ""tenders"" depending on the day, big scoops of hummus were reduced to measured tablespoons, etc.  Also, the new staff seems to constantly be ""hustling,"" which is annoying - shouting at passers-by to try a sample of chicken while effectively ignoring you once you're already in line, pushing ""specials"" that are regular plates with a drink added and priced accordingly, distractedly reminding you about ""three choices!"" you need to make for your plate without so much as a hello or nice to see you again, and so on - look, I appreciate this isn't fine dining, but small things that used to make a difference are no longer there, which is too bad.ALL THAT SAID, the ""stars"" of the plates here - those being the grilled proteins - are all really quite good, and remain a notch above much of the competition.  It's just too bad you get less of it than you used to, for about 30% more than you used to pay, served like you're in the Riverdale High cafeteria."
