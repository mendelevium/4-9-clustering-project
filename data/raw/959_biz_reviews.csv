/user_details?userid=BPhHxkqUvBWdiItkNNuV8A,Jessica P.,"Sterling, VA",4 star rating,"4 stars for ambience, 2 for the food. The cafe is small but quiet, pleasant and shaded with umbrella tables and a large ?maple tree right by the Smith House parking lot. You can easily see one of the trailheads from here. You can see and hear gulls nearby but none came begging for food. I came for lunch on a summer weekday and so it was only half-full, and got quick attention from a friendly bilingual waiter who was patient speaking English to half my party, and French to me (per preference). Food and drinks came relatively quickly, and I ordered the house quiche which a little unevenly cooked but still decent -- and the side salad was pretty delish!"

We asked for water, never came... The staff were so busy and stressed. It's a coordination problem. Not much choices for food around, so we had to go there. But I recommend bring your own food and eat it at the park, stress free..."
/user_details?userid=56pxEGEDkGR5vyLrCCFKMQ,Nancy J.,"Houston, TX",1 star rating,"My husband and I waited ONE hour for a coffee and two sandwiches. Everyone is stressed out and they have no system, so everyone is just running around trying to get orders done. At the end of it, the food wasn't even worth the waiting time at all."
/user_details?userid=5wFEReUADfVdz_jyWmSFxw,Chantelle S.,"Canberra, Australia",3 star rating,"Casual lunch after a long walk through the snow. I have been here a couple of times in successive winters. Always enjoy a warm bowl of soup and a sandwich. It's a tight space and it is very casual in terms of service. That said, I couldn't fault it for what it is. Good food and a welcome spot to recharge before bracing the cold again."
/user_details?userid=_fYRXrSvaDCZIFD8RQPRDQ,Grayson C.,"Charleston, SC",1 star rating,"DO NOT EAT HERE. Waiting in line for 20 minutes to order to go and was told it would be a 15-20 minute wait. Almost an hour later still no food. The kitchen is under staffed and we watched food get dropped and used. Also they are steaming milk that had already been steamed and put back into the cooler which is a health hazard. If you're planning a nice day at Mount Royal be sure to eat before, or bring a picnic."
/user_details?userid=mK_vevYmjDN96JaANSH9Dg,Phina L.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"The worst Antipasto I have ever been served. All cold cut meats and the red peppers were so cold and soggy, difficult to eat, could not even finish it. Only three slices of store-bought Swiss cheese? The only good part about it were the olives, and I bet those came out of a jar. My waitress was lovely, but they are quite obviously understaffed. Should have desperate staff for cafe and dining. A beautiful spot, surprised it's so low funded."
/user_details?userid=veNMtT_bMCGkgRMnTzjuiw,Jay H.,"Saddle River, NJ",1 star rating,"I don't even know where to start.  The cafe is located at a gold mine right by the parking lot and  the picnic area.  The entire out door cafe was run by one person.  She had no idea who came and who left so some people had to wait endlessly.  I saw what was going on so we walked up to the counter and asked her to take the order.  She informed that about half the listed items were not available and it was 12:30 pm.  Considering they have about 10 items on the menu, you have to wonder who runs the place.  I would give 2 stars for food and zero star for service."
/user_details?userid=1IB_dDMaD7WILtHESMVIlA,William R.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Café is incredibly poor value for money, and worse than that, the service is completely disinterested. Our waitress literally walked off and disappeared, and our beverages never arrived. The only time I've ever felt like walking off without paying the bill (which we obviously never received either,) but instead we queued up like good Canadians behind 10 other people and eventually managed to pay. Make your way over to the chalet at Beaver Lac (Lac des castors) instead."
