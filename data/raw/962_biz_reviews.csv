The kitchen is open for all to see, and when you pass by that grill, you'll start getting hungry! Overall, the place has a great vibe.As for the food, they have a great menu, which includes some of the usual brunch staples, but also has some unique options. I went for one of the ""bowls"", which is kinda like a mishmash that you would see at other breakfast/brunch restaurants. It was absolutely delicious. They have a nice set of hot sauces too if that floats your boat. And if you get coffee, they come around every 10 minutes or so to fill it back up. So basically I'm saying it was a great meal in a cool restaurant with great service. I shall be back!"
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"After a shaky first visit I decided to try Bagel Etc again, mainly because I love ""old man breakfast"" places for lunch. I walked in a little later than average at about 12:30 and the place was busy but not crowded.I ordered the Mont Royal breakfast with the yummy St. Viateur bagel on the side. This time around the line chef walked my piping hot and delicious lunch over to my table (recall my last visit review featuring cold eggs and potatoes). What a change! This experience is exactly what I hope for when I walk into a place like this. I might have gone 5 stars but nobody offered to refill my coffee cup during a 40 minute stay. Odd for a breakfast place...Anyway, I am hoping this experience is closer to the norm and I can be a regular here."

I also liked the coffee and the service was good dispute how busy it was it's also not to far from the SQDC for those of you who like to smoke ;)
/user_details?userid=sVV3wstSWCBdqVwK5AzqHw,Nisreen K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Love the huevos rancheros from here.. so yummy.. the coffees here are good too. Love the variety of bread that they have as well. A non pretentious brunch spot that always has a line up. The owner is always on site. A friendly chap.. the servers can be a hit or miss.. The space itself can use an upgrade. A fresh coat of paint and some updated chairs would be welcome. I like the touch of giving Lindt chocolate to the customers once they've paid. :) I would surely recommend checking it out.

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Bagels Etc was a favourite of mine during my student days for its cheap, delicious brunch food.  Despite my affection for this Plateau brunch spot I actually didn't come here for a few years.  Recently though the opportunity to come here presented itself and I jumped on it.  The place hasn't changed a bit since the last time I came here.  It is still rocking the old-school diner vibe and serving affordable and delicious food.Montrealers love their weekend brunches so I was worried that my friend and I would have to wait to get a table.  As luck would have it we were seated right away.  We did come early and my suggestion would be to get here before 11 if you want to avoid waiting because when we left a line-up was starting to form.  Also the dining room is small so you are best to come here as a small group (four people tops).Their brunch menu focuses on the classics like eggs, bacon, pancakes and of course bagels as the name suggests.  I ordered the De Luxe plate which came with a bit of everything and man did they ever give me lots of food.  I actually had to leave some behind because it was simply too much.  That being said it was so delicious!  The potatoes were well seasoned and they used real Montreal bagels.  The pancakes could have been a little fluffier but that was minor.  If anyone knows how to handle the brunch rush its these people.  I was surprised by how quickly our food orders came.  It seems that we had barely ordered before the waitress brought our plates to us.  They also were generous with coffee and water refills.  It seemed that as soon as a coffee cup was empty the waitress was on it right away.I was so happy to see that Bagels Etc hasn't changed a bit since my last visit.  It was every bit as good as I remembered it.  This restaurant is definitely worth the visit when you're craving an affordably and tasty brunch!"

They had an amazing menu full of sandwiches, bagels, all-Day breakfast, and tons of great sides. The decor and seating was uber cute and vintage. I felt like I was back in my grandmothers house. As a vegan I found they missed having great vegan options. But they do have amazing home-fried potatoes, a vegan soup and of course fruit ! I also loved the coffee and found it to be a great cup. Service in the place was very fast for the food. I waited 2 minutes for my food to come after I had ordered it which was soup. My family ordered each a sandwich/bagel with homefried potatoes. It was served right away. The only downfall was the tiny bathroom I'm 6 ft tall so it was a bit tight for me. Also being it's such a great place it was crowded at lunch when we went. Prices are amazing and there is a lot of parking on the street. I'd honestly recommend checking it out ! I only give it 4 because of the wait time to pay as it was crowded and the tiny bathroom."

The staff were all very friendly and accommodating to those in our party that did not speak French. We ordered the standard brunch breakfast (2 eggs, bacon, ham, sausages, potatoes and a bagel), as well as a bagel with cream cheese and lox. The bagels we had were fresh from St. Viateur located just a few blocks north and were exactly how I remembered Montreal bagels.

My boyfriend and I took a trip to Montréal this year it was my first time but second for him and he really wanted us to come here because he insisted that their coffee was AMAZING! Which it was he wasn't lying and the food was the best so filling and delicious, we kept getting refills on our coffee and when it was time to pay our bill it wasn't astronomical it was priced at a diner level. We kept coming to Bagel Etc every morning for breakfast. I would 100% recommend and if I have the chance to visit Montréal again I would definitely come to Bagel Etc for a great meal and coffee!"

We ordered two types of eggs Benedict and the hola omelette. The Benedict's were served on Fairmount sesame bagels which were just perfect. All were spectacular and generous portions were enough to split 2 meals between three people. They had a great little cup of coffee and the wait staff was very pleasant. Our only complaint was that the potatoes were not super hot, but they had a great flavor. We would definitely go back."
/user_details?userid=a2c2wJ5Yo7vMVurhCeYEmw,Becca C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I ended up joining my family for brunch at Bagel Etc due to its history. Long ago, Leonard Cohen was a frequent patron of the restaurant and would even bring his own plate for some quirky reason. The food was great! I had the garden salad with grilled chicken and balsamic vinaigrette. It was very tasty but the dressing was all on top so it required some mixing. Most meals come with a choice of a bagel, challah, or Russian (dark) bread. You can't go wrong with any option, but oh my goodness the challah was phenomenal! I'm still thinking about it now. It is somewhat small so you will have a bit of a wait, but they're quite quick to get you seated."

I had the Monte Cristo and enjoyed it. Nothing negative to say. It's a bit of a walk if you aren't staying in the neighborhood and is not particularly close to a Metro station.

One half resembles a diner and the rest is a series of random pieces thrown together which ends up working out.You get some sort of carb with every menu item. I was on the hunt for a killer bagel and chose the St. Viateur with lox, cream cheese, red onion, tomato and capers. The waitress mentioned they get their bagels from Fairmount so it's no surprise it tasted superb!Service was excellent here. The waitress was helpful and listed other places we should check out in the city."

The skin of the potatoes were so crispy and the potatoes were so soft and chewy. They weren't deep fried, but they were cooked in a way that my mouth will never forget. I got their deluxe on their menu which included two eggs of your choice, ham/bacon/sausage, french toast/pancakes, and toast. I got two eggs sunny side up, ham, french toast, and their challah toast (basically white bread with butter). It was very filling and it was all for about $12. Their french toast was delicious! It was not soggy at all and had a great texture. The atmosphere was fantastic; it was just like an old school dinner. I will definitely come here again!!! It's a small space and I was in a group of 5. So we sat at table of 4 and pulled up a fifth seat at the end of the table."

/user_details?userid=a5XP8GZSDKixOlTmWJ_zwA,Adrien M.,"Manhattan, NY",3 star rating,"The place really feels like an anachronism - in a positive way. The food itself might qualify as dinner fare on the upper end of the spectrum, and was good. Menu choices are plentiful, and I love that food is served with a Montreal-style sesame bagel. Coffee is decent but we were disappointed that they did not have soy or almond milk.Overall, service was markedly curt, and we were made to feel bad by the server who gave us cut-eye for being in her way while walking back from the register in the narrow passageway."

My breakfast bowl was a mix of scrambled eggs, bell pepper, grilled chicken, a Mexican Fresca salsa and roasted potatoes topped with melted cheddar cheese. Needless to say, by the end of the meal, my taste buds and I were satisfied. The service was fast, understanding (we had children at our party), and very friendly.Will be heading there for brunch again soon :))"

It's not a huge place so sometimes there can be a line, but both times it seemed to move quickly. It has a diner look and feel, and service is quick. The food is pretty standard for brunch I think, pretty good but nothing surprising. The serving sizes are quite large though, so there's definitely value there. Prices are similar to normal brunch places, and the coffee is okay."

I brought some friends from NY and we all loved the food. At first I tougght the place is a little over-rated, sure the food is great but the price is average+ and sometimes you have a long line...other places have similar menu. BUT what diffirantiat this place, which gives it the extra star, is that the staff were super nice and the service was extremely fast. So maybe its worth the extra $ since the overall experience was great"
/user_details?userid=B-_c-MJSHWArIl2wkFYXmA,Sarah K.,"Columbus, OH",2 star rating,"The cafe had really cool decor- it was like a throwback to the 60's.The food was good, I got a Huevos Rancheros and my boyfriend ordered a classic breakfast. The food was deilcious! The bagels come on the side of both and the salsa on my plate was SO good.The drawback from this place was the quality of service. Our server came and checked on us once total. We ran out of water and I had a fairly spicy breakfast, and it took her a really long time to refill our drinks.When we were finished with our meal, nobody gave us guidance on how to pay, and so we sat there for about 20 minutes before grabbing our server and saying that we would like to pay our bill. She told us to go up to the counter. There was a gentleman, who I assume is the manager or owner, based on how he was talking to the staff and other guests, who was ringing us out. When my boyfriend pulled out his American credit card (with the chip), he looked at us and told us he couldn't take that.  Over the course of our 4-day trip to Montreal, he was the only one that told us that he couldn't take an American card. I'm still not sure if he just didn't want to deal with an American card or if that was true. From our perspective, he had the same card reader as everyone else - so we aren't sure. As a result, he made us go to an ATM in-house and get Canadian money to pay him with. So with the $2.95 ATM fee, in our eyes, that made our breakfast a bit more expensive.The food was fine- but if you are looking for Montreal bagels, go somewhere else with better service. You'll have an all-around better experience."
/user_details?userid=HqMWEEsYIXoFhdDIX1NtrA,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Very great no frills diner.  We wanted to go to Beauty's, but this was a good second choice. They have all kinds of classic brunch egg dishes, many on Montreal famous style bagels. I had the St Viger which I think was that kind of bagel, toasted with lox, capers, onion and cream cheese. Classic prep with good ingredients.  Hubby had some delicious brunch plate which was a Montreal bagel, eggs, and three types of meats - ham, bacon, sausage. Al good. No complaints.  We had coffees (with little creamers, not surprised diner style), and prompt and polite service. You have to go up and pay and the guy behind the counter kindly gave us some chocolates to go. **note cash or debit only, no credit cards accepted**"
/user_details?userid=OHTXFa3YQY0cB0nzHgjhRw,Yi T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The main reason why I come here is the decor: you feel like you're stepping into a time machine transporting you all the way back in the 1950s-1960s. There's a nostalgic, retro feel to this brunch place, down to the tiniest details. Even the ketchup bottles are in glass, like back in the day, and they have an old brass cash register. The owner is always a delight, and the service is friendly (but sometimes uncoordinated... We got asked if we were ready to order by 2 different waitresses at a 1 minute interval). I've tried a lot of things on their menu:- Pancakes: served hot, they're amazingly fluffy, try the original ones with some butter and maple syrup. Heaven!- Egg Benedict Byzantine: the portion of goat cheese they give you is astonishing, and it's so delicious that you dread finishing your plate. - Huevos Rancheros: a healthier choice perhaps, if you go easy on the sour cream! A classic, it was very good. - Heidi omelette: I would have liked my omelette to taste a bit more like goat cheese (since that's pretty much the feature of the dish). However, the spinach was perfect and the tomatoes weren't overcooked. Their potatoes are the best: not too oily, just crispy enough, with some fried onions and bacon bits thrown in there. And of course, like any self-respecting American-style breakfast place, if you buy a coffee, it's unlimited refills (and they're not skimpy about them either!) Two thumbs up!"

The abundance of hollandaise really brought this dish together for me.  I wasn't a huge fan of the tomatoes, which were too large, too many and too dense for my liking.  Other than that, this was a great comfort food-filled breakfast.  Don't overlook the homefries!The service was quick and friendly, and they made sure your coffee was topped off at all times."

At the recommendation of others I got the huevos rancheros with bacon and was not disappointed. I wanted to get the challah bread (because I love challah) but forgot to mention that while ordering... it was all okay though because the bagel was great too. Everything had great flavor, and it was huge portions and excellent value. Immediately after finishing my MASSIVE plate of food, the first thing I could think was ""Wow that was good. I want to do that again."" I didn't think I could finish it all but it was just too delicious.While the food was five stars, I'm only giving four stars because the service was friendly but not particularly attentive. Despite the long line outside, it took our server at least 20 minutes before taking our order, and probably 20 minutes to get our bill after asking for it. Water refills were hard to come by, especially sine we had a seat by the window, which is out of the way of the main area. Regardless, go for the food, you'll leave a happy customer. The decor is also fun and whimsical."

Ended up ordering a chicken club. My god, that was delicious. No regrets here, this place is clearly the real deal even when there are no bagels to be found.Very cute, homey feeling place with some eccentric renneisance decor.

/user_details?userid=fHrCK0tAEzUPXBVGObGzAQ,Emily L.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Bagels Etc is a STAPLE in the Plateau Mont-Royal area. Between the vintage bar vibes and the friendly owner and staff, there are perfect options for anytime, any day of the week. Personal favourites: 1. Regular breakfast with sausage - I find their sausages absolutely amazing for some reason. They are less salty than other breakfast joints. Their potatoes are just boiled then seasoned on the grill so they're not too heavy for the morning. Their challah is SO GOOD - you have to try it! 2. Smoked salmon eggs benedict - As their name suggests, their benedicts are served on bagels instead of English muffins. This combo goes especially well with cream cheese, smoked salmon, poached eggs and hollandaise. Sometimes if I think potatoes may be too much, I sub out the potatoes for fruit at a small fee. 3. French toast sandwich - It's a different name on the menu but basically it's a french toast sandwich with ham and cheese. It's just the ideal mix of sweet and salty. It's pressed so that the cheese is melted... what more can you ask for? Literally my only complaint at Bagels Etc is that their coffee cups are too small but still, given the quality of the food and service, the dainty coffee cups are still not enough to knock off a whole star from the rating."

I felt relaxed and felt extremely comfortable in their cozy seats. The server was kind, attentive, and the food was delicious. The ham and cheese omelet I ordered was fluffy and had the filling spilling out; the home fries were seasoned to perfection and were the perfect accompaniment to its eggy companion. Visit Bagel Etc!

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and my sister ordered the salty crepes. My plate wasn't so bad, but still mediocre. The crepes were absolutely disgusting! The crepes were too sweet and the filling (chicken and spinach) was flat and soggy. I tried it and couldn't swallow what I ate.

But if you know how to cook than you will be disappointed that you didn't just make breakfast yourself as nothing was noteworthy or outstanding. The pancakes tasted like bisquick or a boxed pancake batter (dense). The French toast was flat and not fluffy or custardy. The sandwich was really strange, served open face with the cheese melted to the outside of it.  Eggs cooked properly. And the breakfast meats were pretty industrial. Not terrible but not good."

The service was really fast and friendly and the ambiance was kitch and fun. Our experience was ruined however by someone who was ""training"" a seeing eye dog.Now we understand that seeing eye dogs need to be exposed to real-life situations like crowded breakfast bistros, but the dog was very young and at the beginning of its training, and it was humungous. The trainer was errantly chatting, and only intervened every 5 minutes to pull the dog (very forcefully in fact) from under our table. I'm scoring the restaurant poorly because there was no conversation with our table about it, no arrangement of the tables and no reprisal for the dog sniffing my bacon. Provided there is no seeing eye dog in training under your table, you'll enjoy the sparkling hosts, cheap eats and shabby chic digs."

So, that obviously sounds amazing. And now that you've made up your mind to eat here, comes the hard part: what to order? In my humble opinion, the only way to go is with the Huevos Rancheros, with bacon inside. It was recommended to me by the chef about 5 years ago, and I've never looked back. Their mega mish mash also looked amazing, but really, you'll be satisfied no matter what you choose."

We decided to stop in Bagel Etc. for a Sunday morning breakfast...and boy are we glad we did. The minute we walked in we knew it was going to be good...and it was. We all ordered The Deluxe. Eggs were done perfectly, french toast was excellent, and the bacon was out of this world. Service was fast, efficient, and super friendly. Prices are incredibly reasonable. It turns out that my son's apartment next year is literally 2 blocks from this restaurant. I suspect he will be spending eating a lot of food from here. Highly recommended."

And yes, the rumors of delicious breakfast potatoes are real. The spuds kick ass. While I'm sure this place is bumping on a weekend, I came around 10am on a Tuesday and had the place to myself.

The decor here is so unique and a marvel just to look at and their food is so well done. You can keep it simple and cheap by getting their Classique, or you can pay a bit more for some sensational omelletes. If you're hungover from the night before, let me tell you, a walk up here would go a long way towards brightening up your morning (or afternoon). I've got the huevos rancheros- very tasty and a bit of a twist (since it comes on a bagel), the pancakes (with walnuts) were filling, and comes with a side of fruit."

I ordered the brunch, which had two eggs, sausage, ham, bacon, and your choice of bread. I chose bagel because of its name! Obviously it wasn't St. Viateur or Fairmount, but it was really moist. The price is pretty decent for a breakfast place, it comes up to around $10 altogether with coffee/tea. The atmosphere is really quaint and cute. I'll definitely come back again to try out their large selection of omlettes!"

Most recently, I brought a friend who was visiting from Toronto and he said it was quite possibly the best omelette he's ever eaten. My usual is the deluxe. It's a big meal complete with eggs, toast, AMAZING breakfast potatoes pancakes or French toast and your choice of meat. I get a side salad instead of the meat. The pancakes are super fluffy. Picture a cross between a biscuit and cake. Soo good! The huevos rancheros are also exceptional. Made with a bagel instead of toast or English muffin and it's genius because the bagel is sturdy enough to stand up to the yummy goodness of over easy eggs and homemade salsa verde. Finally, I also get the sweet cheese blintzes as an ""appetizer"" to share before the meal if I'm feeling super hungry or just super glutonous. The staff and owner are also very friendly which rounds it out to be the best brunch spot in Montreal in my humble opinion."

The Classic (eggs, toast, potatoes, choice of meat) is pretty much unbeatable for value and there's loads of other great things on the menu (standouts include the Hanover, Mega Mishmash, Bobard, and Deluxe). The potatoes are amazing 99% of the time, though I've never been able to identify what causes the 1% of the time when they're not, and the bottomless coffee is probably the most drinkable bottomless coffee I've ever had. The vibe in the place is fantastic and the people who work there are great. Having eaten here so many times I do need to mention that the pancakes are unfortunately not very good, so if you're in the mood for pancakes you should go down the street to Le Vieux St Laurent or up to Beauty's on Mont Royal. Similarly, their fresh fruit options are lacking, though the orange and grapefruit juices (fresh squeezed every day) are tasty. Also avoid the milkshakes, which aren't bad but are not worth the price.The line can be brutal on the weekend, but it's absolutely worth it."

Though hip (which seems to be French-Canadian for 'everywhere') and sufficient, you can do better in a city that takes pride in its eggs.Bagel is certainly A-OK. The breakfast concoctions are tasty and sizable. The made-to-order drinks are made with care and the servers don't mind anglophones. The omelet and eggs benedict were tasty and moderately priced. I guess I was just expecting more. Let me elaborate on my position regarding Montreal bagels. For those of you from the NYC metro area that have not had the ""pleasure,"" a Montreal bagel is basically a drier, firmer, deflated version of the NY analogue. Here, I would argue that America got it right."

/user_details?userid=hYnq9-wO-RzmiTTGMCNJgA,Stephanie C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"My friend said I would like this place and he was right. The fuchsia-painted exterior and the mix of Art Deco and 1950s memorabilia inside appealed to my kitschy whimsical side. Mid-way through the brunch hour and the restaurant was humming with conversations that tried to speak over the background music. All of the tables were full so we had the choice to wait for a booth or sit at the counter. We choose the latter where we were met by our server who promptly placed two mugs in front of us and poured coffee inside them as soon as we sat down. Our food arrived shortly afterward - two eggs, bacon, hash brown potatoes and dark brown toast - and we eagerly ate our food as if it were our last meal. In reference to the two previous reviews about the conversation topics made by the servers, I didn't hear anything inappropriate. From my observation, their banter was nothing more than what they did the night before, what shows or parties they went to, etc. I do agree with Amber's comment that if you sit at the counter, expect to be included in their conversation. But this isn't necessarily a bad thing: the servers are friendly and want to see how you're doing so they aren't shy to say hello to their customers.With that being said, if you're in the mood to enjoy your eggs and OJ in a quiet surrounding, then I wouldn't suggest you come here. Bagel Etc does attract a certain crowd such as students, young to middle-aged couples, or anyone who like being surrounded in an exciting atmosphere. It's not your typical cookie-cutter breakfast chain restaurant, which is exactly why I found it instantly appealing. By the time we left, we saw a line-up of hungry patrons waiting to be seated. I'd be interested to visit this place out during the other times of the day, such as lunch or during the weekday. Of course, this means another trip to Montreal and that's not a bad thing at all!"

Throw in the occasional Leonard Cohen sighting and it was my go to breakfast and brunch joint. So, yeah, this place has been living on its reputation for quite some time. And the prices have gone up, the food has gone downhill, Lenny's out on tour, and the service.... well, the service is something truly special. My only guess is that it's been under new management for a while.  The service is truly atrocious and unpleasant.  Memories be damned: the last time I went is the last time I will go. The wait was forever and there were empty tables everywhere. The servers didn't even bother looking up from their conversation to help us. We had to track down the manager to complain. And he didn't care. And - as already observed - the service makes inappropriate and offensive comments.  One a previous trip (my second to last), the server made some offhand joke about Parkinson's disease (she was jittery when bringing our coffee) when my friend at the table's father is suffering from that horrible disease. They are rude, inefficient and just plain awful. I guess if you like that kind of ""experience"", Bagels Etc is the place for you. For everyone else, go elsewhere."

Omelets (I'm partial to the Hola with fresh salsa, chilis and queso), French toast, variations of Benedicts - all served on bagels from Fairmount Bagel. Yum-may. I don't know how they do it but 3 to 4 guys cook in the space of a pantry and they are a well-oiled machine. Consistently great food (perfect eggs!)Good for singles or groups. The wait is worth it or slide up to the counter for faster service. Warning though - the counter is like sitting front row at a stand-up comedy show. You risk being picked out and asked to give a second opinion on someone's day-glo earrings ('Are zees too 1980'eez?).  Great coffee and espresso, soundtrack varies from Doris Day to Billy Joel and they sell Leonard Cohen CDs behind the counter.

The restaurant was nearly empty but still there was a din of coarse banter from the staff and some of it was less than appetizing, if you see what I mean. I don't call that ""charming"" or ""casual"" I call that a lack of class and a lack of respect for customers. The food was slightly above average brunch fare. Putting salsa on an egg doesn't constitute a remarkable outpouring of creativity in my books. Kind of dated.Truly the Courtney Love of breakfast joints.
