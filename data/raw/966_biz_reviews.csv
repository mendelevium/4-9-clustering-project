/user_details?userid=q7a5NR0Tj6PNIjWxmQjLoQ,Lucy G.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Honestly so excited to have finally tried this spot. As a recent vegan, finding a 100% vegan restaurant where you don't have to ask a million ovo/lacto questions is a TREAT!!! I would recommend stacking your wraps with LOTS of ingredients. The prices are super reasonable so broke veg Concordia students YOU ARE IN LUCK!!! Also the juice is good. Pleasant service and quick food. Highly recommend."
/user_details?userid=CEVpneHUwk4Qhh_sheWfMA,B H.,"Estes Park, CO",5 star rating,This place has fantastic fresh food. I had the mushroom falafel that was vegan and it knocked my socks off. I wish I lived here because it is also such an inexpensive option. I had two falafels for $7. Usually you get what you pay for but here you get sooo much more.  Best food I've had in Montreal so far. Thanks
/user_details?userid=Kj9cFO70zZOQorN0mgeLWA,Faiza K.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"A full and satisfying meal for under $6?  Yup this is the place.  Don't expect anything fancy in the way of the décor - it looks like a fast food space, but the food and the service are lovely.A falafel plate for under $6 can be found here.  Seriously you can't go wrong.  Fill up your belly and be pleasantly surprised that the service here is probably one of the best I've encountered.  the lady (I really wish I knew her name) is so genuinely nice and friendly and talkative (in a good way, not an annoying way) makes it a great experience.While waiting for my food I was just sitting and watching her interact with her customers - even those that took their time deciding what to have - she was always friendly and pleasant.You can do take-out or order/pick-up here.  When back in Montreal, for some cheap eats I will definitely stop in here."

I couldn't ask for more.It's a super cute restaurant, medium sized, and cash or debit only.The lady at the cash is super welcoming and nice! She answered all my questions about the food (I am picky). Perfect place to grab lunch if you go to Concordia and have some time."

/user_details?userid=iiYNf93CLOGDopAARgCXhw,Mike C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"World's best falafel?  Quite possibly.  Unlike 99.9% of the falafel I've eaten--especially as a vegan -their falafel is moist, herbaceous, and not overly cooked and never dry.  After almost 25 years in business, they really have this nailed down solid.  So many tasty vegan options and alternatives for the folks craving the meat versions.   Nilufar is constantly innovating and experimenting with new items like her amazing ""Cauliflower Buffalo Wings"" which taste like a very very good homemade onion ring.  Love garlic sauce? She's developed a vegan version of that too!  Want a shawarma but not the meat?  Try the mushwarma and enjoy the mushrooms and middle eastern spices.  Don't even get me started on the homemade soups. Yum.Oh, did I mention the food is ridiculously almost unbelievably affordable? (I know, right??)Efficient service, cheerful owner, delicious affordable healthy food.If you're a social-minded person you can ask to ""falafel it forward"" - buy a couple falafel pitas that they give to hungry folks in need.  How many starving students would appreciate that?I've eaten there countless times and when I finish this review I've actually gotten hungry enough writing this I'm likely heading there.An absolute Downtown Shaughnessy Village gem for quick, delicious, affordable and HEALTHY eats."

/user_details?userid=Ezl3SmiCE4uZqi0FyqyBSQ,Mary-Ellen F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I usually eat the falafel balls straight up because they're so crispy on the outside and warm and flavourful on the inside, and ask for a side of tahini and hot sauce for dipping. Then if I'm extra hungry I'll get potatoes and garlic sauce and if I'm feelin' really crazy I'll get the BROWNIE. IT'S SO GOOD. IT'S SO CRUMBLY AND CHOCOLATEY DELICIOUS.More importantly though, running this place is an act of nobility in itself on the part of its owner (and the woman who it's named after) Nilu. The prices are so fair that I would argue it takes a moral stance against the  ridiculous fad- and performative-eating that healthy eating has become. It brings things back to basics. Simple, delicious food from a woman you can trust. This is good food and she is good people. You are good person. If you eat here."
/user_details?userid=rkPrz6uwJIefZdH2Oqv4Tg,Christian C.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow! This must be the best falafel I ever had! I'm really impressed with the flavor that comes out of something as simple as a falafel! Crispy, delicious and not too much, which was a good excuse to try the baklavas, and they were so good you won't miss the dairy butter! The vegan mushroom shawarma aka ""mushwarma"" was so fresh and packed with flavor. I wish they would do delivery, that's my only complain!"
/user_details?userid=LC1-h542s1k1OxNs7QzwNA,M Akter T.,"Cornwall, Canada",4 star rating,Very affordable and good food. It's not a place where you go for fancy dates but it will keep you well fed when you are a student and are running low on money.The staff behaviour is good and is in a good location.
/user_details?userid=jMHlwDq5b2zqhV5TyyFKPA,Yojna J.,"Victoria, Canada",5 star rating,"This is probably my new happy place for falafel wraps! Decided to give it a shot for lunch today and I was so surprised that it'll be that delicious and filling for so less. It took me 10 minutes to get there and to my surprise, it was crowded but the service was quick and efficient. The lady that served me was so nice and sweet. She also recommended that I should go for the mega falafel as it's my first time as it comes with fries. In addition, she said that I could get a choice of 3 sauces, garlic, vegan garlic and spicy. I went for the garlic sauce and it didn't disappoint. On to my first bite, I fell in love with it and oh my days, the sauces gave it a special addition as well a blast to my palette. The place is great to have lunch. There are many tables and I'd definitely return to try other foods on their menus but the mega falafel was the highlight of my day!"

I always passed by this place but never bothered going in until one day, I was parked right nearby. I'm so glad I tried it out! The food was so fresh, better than any Lebanese fast food chain I've ever tried. And the best part is that the price is so fair. Great staff as well. I'm definitely going back and recommending this place to others."

/user_details?userid=r69ALWSKhMabbo9BzhoT_Q,Sarah B.,"Middleton, MA",5 star rating,"Nilufar is an incredible place to grab a bite to eat if you are downtown. I've been living in Montreal for 4 years and I've never found a place so cheap with such delicious food. For less than $5, you can get a falafel wrap, a soup and a juice. I can't say enough good things about this place. The owner, Nilufar, is hilarious and so sweet. I've never had a less than stellar experience here."
/user_details?userid=aPTxdV3iOlOPs9usJ1yE_w,Kait M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Nilufar is hands down one of my all-time favourite restaurants in Montreal. Just looking at the photos on their Yelp page is making my mouth water!I first came across these guys, as many do, when I was a student at Concordia. I lived half a block away and I am not exaggerating when I say that I ate here probably 5 times a week. Their falafel wrap, soup and drink combo is so affordable that it's hard (impossible) to pass it up on the walk home from school.Fast forward five years, and although I no longer live downtown and no longer have the same limited student food budget, but I am *still* constantly looking for an excuse to hit up Nilufar! For starters, the service is incredible! Have you ever met a restaurant employee who knows all of their customers by first and last name? Not only does this bring a community aspect to the restaurant (somehow, in the middle of downtown Montreal), but it also makes you feel like your business is appreciated.Second, their falafel is absolutely incredible. They're always, always super fresh -- which is huge when it comes to what makes a good falafel. Even when I've gone to more expensive Middle Eastern restaurants, I haven't found a falafel this crisp and tasty.Finally, they're so attentive to food allergies and dietary preferences. Vegan? No problem. Gluten free? They have you covered. Paleo? I'm sure they can help you out.Whether you're a student or not, do yourself a favour and pick up a Nilufar falafel ASAP."

/user_details?userid=oeXK1n5rzwBZN_v017oPFg,seeley q.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I wanted to like this place.  My first visit was yesterday, I think I was the first customer before lunch rush.  I agreed to try a full plate, including falafel, aubergine, hummus with pickle garnish, tabouli, a dressed green salad, and pita bread.  This plate comes to $8 with tax.  + the falafel did indeed taste good, and was better done than most others I've had.+ the sauteed (or grilled?) aubergine slices had nice texture, hummus and dressing for the simple salad were fairly basic yet satisfying.- styrofoam plate; disappointing that they've been in business so long but don't offer reusuable, or compostable dishware and utensils, or even unbleached napkins.  I don't want to add to their plastic waste.- when I first went to eat tabouli, which was mostly a parsley and tomato mix, my fork went to a tomato piece that had a small bad spot, and a produce sticker on it.  Not what anyone wants to eat.  Photo attached.  I was hungry and ate the rest of plate while checking bites first, waited till ready to leave, and brought the piece on plate to the counter.  I came up when there Wasn't a line of customers for lunch, and just presented it calmly with ""fyi, this was in salad""--but she just quickly passed it into the garbage with ""I'm sorry"" and no indication of talking to the kitchen staff who was sloppy enough to serve this plate.I'm not encouraged to return."

Everything from the ambiance, the friendliness of the staff, the affordability and food variety (they cater to meat eaters, vegans, vegetarians, halal free) is just out of this world! Show some love to these guys because they definitely deserve it!"
/user_details?userid=AqPOjOQAqaTf45VU-B6veQ,Michael P.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,"What a disappointment the food was terrible. Where do I begin well the hummus was tasteless as like they  just ground chickpeas up that is it there was no garlic, tahini, cumin or olive oil. There was zero taste I mean zero taste. The rice was the the same thing flat zero taste just plain boiled rice. The tabouli looked great but no taste to it but parsley. I have made tabouli myself there was no lemon taste or olive oil or garlic  not even a bit of  mint to kick it up a notch. The shawarma was the biggest problem on the plate finally something with some taste Way Too much taste all I could taste was salt like a lot of salt as if a whole  cup full was poured in it. It was so bad I threw out half the meal. I work for 28 years in a Lebanese restaurant i know what the food should taste like seem a lot people in Montreal do not or a least those that love this place don't."

As a broke stupid living beside Concordia, Nilufar becomes my second home when it comes to food. The food is always fresh and did I mention CHEAP?!!!!! How can you have something SO amazing and mouth watering and have it be less than $2... its witchcarft.... no but really I dont care what it is, the food, the price and the amazing service is what keeps me coming back!Also best falafs I've ever had in my life. No Big Deal."

/user_details?userid=LemDESTKgAfeTiHOaE08jg,Laura R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"After a long search for the perfect falafel sandwich, I am happy to say that I have finally found it, my search is over; thanks in great part to the Yelp community and thanks in part to being 6 months pregnant and having an intense and unquenchable falafel craving. Nilufar, herself, greeted me as soon as I entered her restaurant. She is a beautiful woman with a lovely smile and she is really friendly despite busily manning the counter all by herself. Her falafel sandwich is wonderful: hot and flavorful! The tzatziki sauce is so wonderfully cool and luscious and the hummus is so creamy I was half-convinced she must add heavy cream to her garbanzo beans. Best of all, I ate like a queen for about $3. If I lived closer to Nilufar, I promise you, I would be here every other day!"

No other means for payment. :( took over 10 minutes to process my order although I did change it.. Kind of a busy place and only 1 person processing those orders in the kitchen and 1 person at the cash so service is slow but very friendly. Hence, one star off for those reasons.. Amazing falafel - bit crunchy.. Nice cumin flavor :)Shish taouk was great, too! Fascinating menu + Really amazing prices. Will definitely come again to sample other items from the menu, especially, the soups!"

She's super chill and down to earth.But this is a restaurant Yelp review and not Tinder so onwards!Looking at this place from the outside, you'd think that you pretty much get what you pay for. You'd think that a $1.50 falafel will taste like a $1.50 falafel. Well fictional you is wrong! These falafels, shawarma, shish-taouk(sp?), etc are really good. I mean it's not Boustan's but I'd even eat here even if I was filthy rich. Which I am not. So from the point of view of a really broke student, this stuff is delicious and cheap and absolutely perfect."

It was crunchy on the outside and soft and green on the inside. You have to get them fresh while they are hot and crispy. The side dishes are awesome too. They serve mostly Mediterranean vegan dishes.The restaurant is named after their daughter Nilufar who manages the restaurant and is friendly. All around they serve high quality food at a great value."
/user_details?userid=MYr_7OhQNfDW5W4EfrrIxQ,Mihai D.,"Beaconsfield, Canada",4 star rating,"As a fairly cheap and broke Concordia student, I like this place. I REALLY like this place.The 2$ trio became 2.50$ trio (including cheap drink in a styrofoam cup, a falafel sandwich and a soup of your choice). It is THE best quality/price Lebanese restaurant I ever set foot in.Granted, the portions seem smaller than other Lebanese restaurants but it's still at a higher quantity/price ratio that I've ever seen. The pitas are the freshest I've ever tasted and the service is fairly fast. The lady at the counter seems hateful towards life but is actually really friendly if you bother to throw more than a ""Hi I'd like X, Y and Z please"" at her.The place is kind of small and cramped but with those prices, it's to be expected. The chairs at the tables seemed to have been stolen at a local daycare center and the tables wobble.Recommended. :)"

They offer really affordable food (very suitable for students) and they're really good! Super vegetarian-friendly (and vegan as well, since they've asked me if I want the sauce vegan) as well, which always makes me happy. The cashier lady is a pleasure to always see, she's very friendly and fun to talk to. The place is a little small but the rotation is fast and it's good to take away food as well. Overall, it's going to be my regular go-tos from now on. I regret not going earlier!"

Their decor is student friendly and the people behind the cash are very nice. You kind of get what you pay for, but for those without a big appetite and a small budget, it's a good option.But just don't expect the greatest shish taouk plate and you'll be fine."
/user_details?userid=WXgFEaQQ-YJag55nTN9r1Q,Eve D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Nifular was a godsend for me when I was studying at Dawson. The prices are so ridiculously good, I hardly ever leave the restaurant having payed more than 5$ and it's way more filling (and healthier) than anything I could get on the value menu at McDo or the likes. My favourite is their mega falafel (the regular falafel pita.... BUT WITH FRIES INSIDE), I have it nearly every time with their garlic sauce and spicy sauce, sooo good and only 2,50$. The only reason why I'm not putting 5 stars is because the portions could be bigger and I've had some pretty inconsistent experiences with how the pitas were arranged inside (lacking certain ingredients, falafels stuffed at the very bottom of the wrap, ...), but when considering the price of the food, it's hardly a drawback.P.S.: The cashier is super duper friendly, I love her. She's there every day, it's really nice to see a familiar face every time I stop by for some falafel :)"
/user_details?userid=1lRbzzJ5yXGq6K0CpUCbMw,Chris B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Finding healthy eats is challenging these days unless you're willing to pay a premium price.  Restaurant Nilufar bucks that trend by delivering simple and healthy middle eastern cuisine at a great value.Small and unassuming, the restaurant is a no frills establishment within walking distance of Concordia. The owners are friendly and prices start at less than $2 for a wrap.  A satisfying lunch with a drink can be had for less than $6 and a massive amount of food can be yours for less than $10 bucks.The vegetarian falafel wrap is some of the best food you can get in Montreal for under $2 bucks. Two crispy on the outside moist on the inside falafels wrapped in a flour tortilla filled with shredded lettuce and then topped with tahini sauce and add hummus, babaganoush, or another spread for a bit extra.If a wrap isn't going to cut it for you, then go for a hearty plate of rice, nan bread and a variety of middle eastern sides and mains, many of which are displayed in the deli counter and look delightful.  The focus here is on great food at a great value, everything else is just a distraction."

The windows that line the front of the restaurant allow plenty of light despite it being slightly lower than street level. The cashier was a doll and you could tell by listening to her interactions with regulars that she's part of the charm and reason for the repeat business. I splurged the extra 25 cents for garlic sauce in my wrap and I would suggest you do the same. I was impressed at the significant choice of soups and was pleasantly surprised that they make a point of serving the juice in a larger-than-normal styrofoam cup rather than something that doesn't hold more than a juice-box. You won't find a better lunch for $2, that I can guarantee."

The best way to describe it is homemade comfort food. My favorite is the shish taouk (chicken) sandwich. The combination of spiced chicken and garlic sauce is addicting. I always have it with the barley ginger soup too which has literally cured my colds on more than one occasion. The woman at the counter is one of the coolest people in the city.

Not 100% vegan but they have so many vegan options I always feel satisfied when I go. And omg the prices? They've mastered portion size and simple cooking and have managed to keep the prices perfect for students and people on a small budget. My only complaint is the waste factor. I'd be willing to add a few extra dollars to do away with the styrofoam...or I'd love to see some sort of alternative packaging model put in place (ie bring your own container etc).
/user_details?userid=IA9xPAsKXFu96SKU3xKThw,Amanda R.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"Decent place, obviously can't expect ambiance because of the cheap nature of the menu. This is the ideal place for broke college students and the owner herself serves you and takes orders. Prices range from $2-$5 for full meals. I personally don't find one falafel pita to be satisfying so keep in mind if you're going in hungry it will be a minimum of $5 required to make you feel full. The quality of the actual food isn't exactly anything worth mentioning but for the price it is good."

/user_details?userid=i-rfAdH3NLw9fzLlkc1P8w,Jay K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Cant complain for the price! 1.50$ for a falafel, much better than paying close to 10$ for one at green panther (although it is better overall) My one complaint is that the women at the counter is always on the phone! I dont really care but it can be annoying."
/user_details?userid=L3RkqelOGJBRXICDoDDBQQ,Chris P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Defiantly good bang for your buck but if you don't want something that's been sitting around for a whole ask for it fresh.
/user_details?userid=XMAXpZsBQEuk0f2xlyZ6vw,Blake G.,"Las Cruces, NM",4 star rating,"Must certainly be the best $1.29 lunch in North America.I had a falafel. It was small, yes, but really enough and quite good. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would go here all the time."
/user_details?userid=7DVPht9PhkC1xh6PZzBusw,Grace B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It's not quite as cheap as it initially seems because you have to pay extra to get an all dressed pita (the regular price only includes lettuce, tomato, and tahini ; no onions, turnips, etc.) And the garlic potatoes aren't as good as Boustan. But the falafel is really good, probably better than Boustan, and it is a bit cheaper as well."

/user_details?userid=c7C5QziJbx6JOnQFiOxUXQ,Youri H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm on my way to Concordia and hungry when I passed Nilufar. Having remembered getting decent $0.99 falafel there a while back I decided to try it for something more substantial. I ordered a shish taouk platter that came quickly enough, and it wasn't terrible. Really, the best part about it was that it was $6.75 after tax which is amazing for any meal. Not the most amazing shish taouk I've ever had, but I'd definitely go back,"
/user_details?userid=h--BtpfIAwH0ECC7uUQdJA,B A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,The falafel they have is delicious and juicy. The price is great for this little gem. I know this place for almost 10 years. I always come back when I miss the Lebanese Falafel. It is not exactly like the Leb one but the best I can get here.
/user_details?userid=3mVMqNIvOumVbkyHXNmgUg,Marc A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've only been once.  I read about it in The Concordian.  I'd read that you can get a falafel sandwich with lentil soup and a cup of juice for $2 and had to see for myself.  There was a sign on the door that said, ""Vegan's delight!""  I liked that.  The place itself is small, cozy, and looks a bit run down.  I have to admit I wasn't really compelled to sit down to enjoy my meal.  But the interior's sort of like any other place in that area.I didn't get that $2 special though.  Upon seeing that a falafel sandwich was $1.29, I got two to go.  It came out to only $3 after taxes.  I walked back to school and ate them there.  They were truly delicious.  Cheap enough and good enough for me.  Waaaay cheaper than the falafels found around Concordia, and just as good.  I will definitely be back many times over."
/user_details?userid=IryDYja2kFkQEYJ0Kw6GWw,S. S.,"Bloomington, IL",4 star rating,"As stated before, the price couldn't be nicer for the special. Good variety of soups so you can try something new. The falafel itself is crispy on the outside yet moist on the inside and bursting with flavor. My only complaint was the wait. It felt like orders were being taken and processed in slow motion. The cashier was very friendly and helpful otherwise."
/user_details?userid=5AEYOLE0s9ZoX1wI1ZPFoQ,Crystal L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've only had the falafel sandwich from here (many times!) but it's good and lunch for less than $1.50!!!!  They even have a combo where you can get a falafel sandwich, soup and juice for $1.99.  Always fresh fast and friendly."
