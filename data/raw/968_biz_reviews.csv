/user_details?userid=m55GeE64-_Rh9P3GcNRFvw,Andrew C.,"Churchville, PA",4 star rating,"Good food, waiter was a little abrasive about what we were ordering. They were open supposedly open for another hour in a half but he seemed rushed to get us out. However in the end he was partially right about some things as it wound up being a lot of food. That just meant some decent leftovers for the next day."
/user_details?userid=P8WKdwdpRZ4F1SMTLAL_nw,Ran N.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"I usually have an iron stomach, able to eat anything and everything. After leaving this restaurant, my friends and I all got food poisioning. This has never happend before so I was quite surprised.The service was pretty awkward and semi offensive. As soon as we walked in, we were stopped and clarified that they do not serve south indian food. We were taking by surprise because none of us asked if there was south indian food or cared really, we were just hungry lol. We thought maybe they thought this way because 2/3 friends I was with were dark skinned. When we ordered, my friend ordered tandoori chicken, and the waitor's first immediate response was ""are you sure? it's not spicy"". We thought he was joking and tried laughing but he was genuinely surprised that again, my darker skinned friend, ordered a sweet dish. We had a paneer curry, tandoori chicken curry, naan bread, and briyani. There are a ton of vege options to pick from. The food itself wasn't amazing. Didn't taste as flavourful as other indian restaurants that I frequent usually do. The portions are also ridiculously small. The only good part of the meal was the naan bread. It was huge, about 20 cm in radius, delicious and soft. When we asked the waitor if we can share it, he said it's only big enough for one person, but it came out ridiciously big and we couldn't finish all of the ones we ordered. Overall, I do NOT recommend anyone going here. Definately is not worth it."
/user_details?userid=hSNEWH508zv-Ouong3zFqg,A K.,"Morgantown, WV",3 star rating,"Nice looking restaurant on Ave St Laurent.We had the Kashmiri Chicken, Lamb Biryani and Nan.The chicken was dry and the sauce was just okay.  The lamb was tender and the Biryani was tasty.  It was prepared different than we have experienced with julienned vegetables on top and a hard boiled egg in the center.  The egg actually works surprisingly well.  The Nan was puffy and warm and really pretty good.  I prefer a little char on it making it crispy in spots.Rice does not come with your curry dish.  Our side of rice was quite good.Service is efficient but cheerless.We had a decent meal here.  Just not a memorable one."

We get take-out from here all the time and sometimes eat in. My favourites are the chana masala, palak paneer, and mushroom bhaji (not the fritter, rather pav bhaji- a thick vegetable curry) Big fluffy naan bread, big crispy papadums. Yum! One of the best Indians in town, and they deliver!"

/user_details?userid=Aqv4o-pTGzAdb5ZZKKzAGQ,Sarah W.,"Houston, TX",3 star rating,I had the saag paneer which was the tiniest portion I've ever seen at any Indian restaurant. It also had very little paneer. I supplemented this tiny dish with  a piece of naan which was HUGE! I felt like the the ratio of saag to naan could have been better. The biryani was pretty good though.
/user_details?userid=CRZGng83lIivV22iV5Rgxg,Raghu R.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I am usually a very tolerant person but i was proved wrong at my visit to Mysore Restaurant (BTW the restaurant has nothing to do with Mysore/India). The so called food (Poor quantity) took way too long to arrive and except for the DAL, all the dishes were a complete disaster to be precise. We ordered their special Chicken Jalfrezi which was smelling and tasting like BACON!! I was asked for a feedback by the staff of the restaurant and when i gave my honest opinion, they were reluctant to even consider it. Their response was ""this is our best dish, this is the first complaint we have received in 18 years!!!""In sum, i am never going back to this place and would recommend not to spoil your evening by going there."
/user_details?userid=-KpEgEen1tj-jdjIS7uVOw,Isabelle R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Although I have lived on the plateau for over 30 years, I had never been to Mysore before. I passed it several times and always thought it looked too fancy for my wallet (me heading to Jean talon usually for indian). But today we went for lunch and man was it delicious, satisfying and super reasonably priced. Their lunch special comes with daal soup, loads of delicious saffron veggie rice, salad, a main and coffee and dessert. For 10$. The saag paneer was creamy and tasty and filled with other veggies too. The butter chicken was smokey and creamy. All very yum. We had a pakora appetizer and the portion was enormous and they were delicious. I will be coming back again."

/user_details?userid=sKVpHfhkG_Nvgf_Vfb91Cg,Janine T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I am writing this review 4 hours after I ate here and I am still ridiculously full. Despite what I see as having an unfortunate name, this place is a pretty solid lunch choice. They use the perfect amount of spice and their sag paneer is completely kick ass. The naan bread was perfection and the service was great. Cheap beer too which is a winner in my book."
/user_details?userid=i1XAHltBpZC5zP5skcwVGw,Jinko G.,"Altadena, CA",3 star rating,"It's very hard to find great Indian food in Montreal.  I've tried few others, and so far this is my favorite.  We were seated upstairs which has a nice atmosphere on a busy Friday night.  If you want a quiet private dinner I highly recommend sitting upstairs.  We tried a large assortment of dishes.  All well prepared and nice portions. The only issue I have with most Asian food in Montreal is that it's too sweet.  Even the spicy dishes tend to have an underlining sweetness of maple syrup or sorts."
/user_details?userid=PU5QaMADa6N_9ZoQ04ZjOw,Zachary S.,"Minneapolis, MN",4 star rating,"I felt like a python when leaving. I may not need to eat for another 3 months.We got the suggested sharing menu for two and it was a shit ton of food. The appetizers were so so. Great naan. They really showed their true colors in the entrees & sauces therein.Nicely spiced but not clobbering you over the head with the spice. very nuanced.If we didn't have a personal recommendation from our inn keeper, we would have walked right by."

/user_details?userid=qbVCbF6bQxcd-N70mSo6rQ,GoVeg R.,"Potsdam, NY",3 star rating,"We happened into Mysore in a rainstorm, hungry with legs tired from walking all day--weekend visitors to Montreal. The atmosphere inside was inviting, candles on the tables, nice lighting and decor, friendly waitstaff. We are vegetarians, and ordered our favorites that we usually have in Indian restaurants: dal, saag paneer, mushroom curry, pakoras and naan. The food was good--My favorites were the daal  and the naan. My husband liked the saag more than I did--it was a bit too buttery tasting for my liking, but that's just individual taste. Overall, it was a very pleasant ending to a busy and fun day."
/user_details?userid=T40u1FJXOOYs3rmOnwGm6A,Kiera S.,"London, United Kingdom",3 star rating,"Good food, good service. Try ordering one of the sharing menus (""CC"" was great). More than enough for two people, and provably more than enough for three. Nothing spectacular, but pretty solid. The house wine is ok."
