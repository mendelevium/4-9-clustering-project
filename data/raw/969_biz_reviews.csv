You can grab a lobster club sandwich and a glorious bottle of crazy good imported MIkkeller beer or so many exceptional local Dunham classics to eat and drink in the park at a safe distance from others but still soaking in the spring sun and letting that beer and Quebec lobster transport you to a dream of a better tomorrow.
/user_details?userid=7YEDo9G-mor6KoJlN8jO0Q,Libby W.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"Total 5 star beer selection and service from Lauren (and the whole staff)! Loved the poutine with beer gravy. Vices & Versa was the only stop we made twice during our 4 days in Montreal - we made sure to make a second visit before leaving town. On our first visit, Lauren gave us some really awesome recommendations for the next day. Don't know if/when we'll be back in Montreal (we were in town for a wedding), but V&V is definitely on our can't-miss list."
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",3 star rating,"Vices et Versa and I have a long history of love and almost hate. I remember many many years ago, when the pub was just one room and how impressive was the list of local beers offered for tasting of six on carousel, real carousel that rotates... Immediately Vices et Versa became the place I would bring visitors in Montreal to try local products, cheeses and charcuteries, combined with brews from every single spot in Quebec, where there is a microbrewery. Over the years we loved coming back for the amazing carbonnade of bison and the poutine with peppercorn gravy. The space expanded with a second room and the service started going slowly downhill. Then came our atrocious experience on the terrace one labor weekend, when we were ignored consistently and simply not served after the first order. For few years I did not step back in Vices et Versa, even writing a proper review seemed to be unjustified as I would have slammed the pub, because of an obnoxious lack of service. About my last visit.... Vices et Versa has added a third room to the pub. More space is always welcome as well as new clean bathrooms. The list of beers consists of almost 40 superb brews, but is not readable at all. Try to get descriptions of 40 beers from the person taking care of your happiness, impossible to remember and hard to choose. What we did is, we started googling the beers as to choose a sampler that will allow us to taste some of this liquid goodness, the googling was absolutely random, based on the names of the breweries we could not decipher right away. Here comes the simple idea, why a brewpub as Vices et Versa, in 21st century, cannot maintain an online list of the available beers, with links to the breweries web pages, that offer amazing descriptions of their products. We all have our cell phones and could have done a quick research right on the spot, allowing the waiter to spend less time with you describing beers and attend to more clients. This is how one improves service that suffers of under-staffing. Otherwise all the beers we had were amazing. The bison dishes are off the menu long ago, we had the pulled pork poutine, which was decent and cornet of fries, which were average. Meaning I would no longer advertise to my friends Vices et Versa as one of the best places to try poutine in town. I'm still a huge fan of Vices et Versa and I will continue to visit sporadically, but I would like to see basic improvements before I vote this place as five stars."

Guys were happy with their burgers, and my Jerk Chicken sandwich was very tasty despite not being the traditional jerk that I'm used to.  It came with a nice salad as well."
/user_details?userid=sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",4 star rating,"A Gastropub with a skilled kitchen and an astonishing​ Craft Beer setlist​? Count me in. Ask any American what Canada is known for and you will quickly get 3 entries​: Maple Syrup (Vermont may argue they are better), Canadian Bacon (didn't see this once while in Canada), and Poutine. That makes Poutine the quintessential​ dish of Canada in my 3-second​ litmus test. After asking many locals where to find Montréals best I found myself at Vices et Versa and life was good. Very good. Vices et Versa is a Gastro​ if nothing else and they shine​ with pub grub as they should. They offer many of the staples​ you would expect for the genre and even have some Latin crossovers which are​ fun for someone from SoCal since I will never again​ see Dos Tacos de Porc Effiloché in place of ""Carnitas"" on a menu again in my life. And no - I didn't get Carnitas in Canada - I live mere miles away from Santa Ana. Get it together already. What I did get was the Poutine sauce à la Bière. Yes, Poutine with Beer Sauce. What else could one ask for? Double Blanched Fries. Cheddar Cheese Curds molten by the heat of said Fries. Salt. Heaps of Salt. All of the above drown in a ladle's​ dollop worth of Beer reduced pan sauce. This is everything right with the world today and the best 8 loonies I spent while in Quebec. Best with a crisp and piney IPA or Pale Ale. They have both on tap. Je t'aime Vices et Versa. Jusqu'à la prochaine fois..."

We were so pleased. We tried the poutine and a side salad (balance y'all). Both were excellent. My husband had a beer and said it was the best he'd had in Canada yet. Our waitress was also really lovely and you can't beat good service.

Service was just ok, not as nice as you at use to getting here in Montreal. Good choice of beer.Mom didn't like her salad, it was not very tasty and the poutine sauce is very strong in beer for a child, maybe."
/user_details?userid=RDoxmfAirCFw7-7xfaPYnA,Lynne S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"Very charming spot to get a good beer or draft cider on a hot summer day.  Draft beer list is extensive, written in chalk on boards throughout the pub. A complaint I have is that the handwriting is a little bit hard to read and the full details about each beer are not available on the boards (the brewer, for example), so particularly if you are not a native French speaker, you may not really know what you're getting into unless you ask about the beer. It can be a little overwhelming with 40 options to choose from. Also, having researched the places to get draft cider in Montreal, I was disappointed to find only 2 true ciders on the menu, and one which is a cider - kombucha hybrid. The hybrid tasted like water.The atmosphere is lovely, especially the rear garden-esque seating, food is yummy (veggie burger A+++), and service is friendly."
/user_details?userid=E2oq_BwdQmq_Vyte65icNg,Emeline V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Am I a pub? Am I a restaurant? Am I big? Am I small? Vices et Versa doesn't know! And neither do I. I went there with a group on a Monday and it was way chill, the waiters are on the ball, and I got to try plenty of their stuff: their poutine is super boozy, a must if you want to include more beer to you food ;) The nachos are very good, but the gems are on their blackboard.  Speaking of, check out their 40+ selection of beers, there really is something for everyone, but if no one agrees, you have the amazing option of ordering a ""platter"" or 6 small glasses of different beers!I was so into it that I dragged my date along a Friday night. It was less chill - the place, which is surprisingly roomy - was jam-packed. We didn't so much get a table as two chairs at the end of a large group table so we were right in the middle of a group of 3's conversation. Neither our spot nor the conversation impressed us. But it's convivial, the people at the end of the row flagged our waitress when my meal was ready because everyone hears it all so why pretend? Frankly they could easily remove 5 tables and make it possible for you to walk to your table without clawing your way out. I made the mistake of ordering the calamari without realizing it was as expensive as a main dish, don't do that, but come by when it's nice and quiet for sure."
/user_details?userid=WkAiFAJMI7aZPjFqMvsGbA,Sarah R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If this place was closer to home, I imagine it would become a regular hang-out! It has a very chill feel, unlike some of the other places we visited for beer this particular evening. It is not very large, so it may be hard to find a place at peak times. We got one of the last tables around 9 PM on a Friday, but there were still a few places at the bar.The beer menu is ridiculous! So many good choices. One drawback of having so many beers is a lack of space for being able to describe them. And because they have so many, it seems they rely on chalkboard rather than printed menus (which makes sense).We opted for the flight to be able to try 6 different beers. We may not have made the best choices, some were just ok. I especially liked the Saison Brett from Les 3 Mousquetaires.We didn't have food, but the menu included some traditional bar food (burgers, poutine) as well as some small bites (nuts, olives, pickles). I will have to come back to try some food and the patio in the summer!"
/user_details?userid=IPsKAiMjFj39dN_ckOsMMg,Jamie N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",5 star rating,"When we first walked in, I thought it was closed because it was absolutely desolate in its dining room. However, if you continue to walk through to the patio, this is where the party is at! With temperatures in the high 70s to low 80s and a full day spent walking, a fresh beverage on a breezy deck was exactly what we needed.Although we had originally planned to hit up another spot, we decided to venture into Vices et Versa because the patio area seemed nice, the local tap list also carried brews from Dieu du Ciel and there was more of a local vibe/atmosphere, which is much appreciated without having to fight for a server's attention, nah mean?It's a seat yourself kind of place and menus are already on the table. If you don't know what beer to get, ask your server. They are super helpful with trying to match to your preferences with options to sample. Since it was warm out, I was feeling something on the lighter side like a blonde or lager. I was given five suggestions and decided to go with the Blanche de L'ermitage, which was comparable to a Blue Moon with a Belgian finish.Since we had spent most of the day exploring museums and walking downtown, we had worked up an appetite. With three options for poutine, we asked our server what would be best. For sweet, she suggested the pulled pork and for savory, the chipolata (pork sausage). We went with the savory option to pair with a small green salad to share.Portions are pretty fair in terms of food. The chipolata tasted like a lighter version of longanisa (Filipino sausage) without the crazy garlic burps. Poutine was drenched in beer gravy with plenty of cheese string pulls, but even better that I didn't feel heavy after consumption. The salad was a very good mix of leaves, almonds, olives, julienned carrots and tomatoes.Menu is small, but the focus is the beer list, which taps at least 30 different options from Canada. Breweries such as Dieu du Ciel, Brasserie Dunham, Unfiltered Brewing (Nova Scotia), Casa Breton had a solid representation on the list. Wished I was more knowledgeable about Canadian beers to really enjoy/explore the options, but I'll be more prepared whenever I plan to return to Canada."

Our waitress could not get our beer orders right and when she brought out a larger beer for someone in my party her solution was just that my friend just needed to suck it up and pay for it.

/user_details?userid=dIQm-fWJHQ6hKsUUU7GllA,Danielle G.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"The back patio is amazing! In a city that is so cold so much of the year, nobody would blame a little brew-pub like this for maximizing their square footage with indoor space. Instead they serve their pulled pork poutine and make-your-own carousels (6 beer flights) under a canopy of tree branches.Our server was kind and attentive. We asked him to make us a carousel with his faves, and he gave us quite an interesting variety. When he found out we were from the States, he went back to the kitchen to write down a few of his favorite local breweries and their addresses on a sticky note for us. So thoughtful!Honestly, the food won't blow you away. But if you need a simple dinner or a bar snack while you're sipping and chatting a lazy evening away, you'll find something to enjoy.Highly recommend, at least in the warmer months."

It was really warm out, so I was glad we could grab a spot in the back terrace since it was packed! Thankfully we only had to wait 15 minutes before a table cleared out. Besides the bartender, there was not another soul indoors though. There doesn't seem to be any A/C inside so it was stiflingly hot! The service was great, friendly staff and prompt. I'm not a beer drinker but judging from the wide assortment of ales and stouts on the drink list, I'm sure anyone could find their perfect pour, except me..haha! I'm a hard liquor and wine kinda girl, so was so happy to see the L'Orpailleur wines available as our only choice, either red or white. As for the venue, it was nice to seat in the breeze and be able to converse with no loud music blasting in the background. The patio is comfortable albeit the wood chairs. In all, anyone who likes a good brew and a laid back spot to catch up with friends, this venue does it! The reason I gave it four stars is mostly because the drink selection is very limited, and the tables were a little sticky and could use a good wipe down."

The portion is enormous. All I could think about was how divine it would be to get that plate when tipsy and hungry past the witching hour. Sadly, the evening I was there, this was not to be.

They constantly rotate which make's all the more fun too! Although I wasn't really hungry, Risa insisted on Poutine as I imagine every Canadian does everywhere they go. It was my first poutine in Canada and it set the bar high. I could definitely see eating this a few times a week now."

I went for the pulled pork poutine and it was so close to being a 5 star poutine.  I thought the peppercorn in the beer sauce added a nice touch and the fries were awesome.  The cheese curds though weren't squeaky enough for my liking.  The pulled pork was moist and juicy though.In all I loved my first visit to Vices and Versa and wished I lived closer so I could come here more often.  The terrasse is awesome, the beer selection is fantastic and the food is tasty.  This place is definitely a must try if you're in Little Italy."

/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Okay, I might get quite a bit of flack from giving this place a less than average review, but I have my reasons. I was really excited to try this place and have heard GREAT things about their craft beer and pub grub, and given my ""will travel for good food"" motto, of course I was going to visit it sooner or later. My first impression of Vices et Versa was that it was very cozy and rustic and had so much potential; it would have been a great place to bring friends and catch up over the week's happenings. I got the beer sampler of six different types of beer with a pulled pork poutine. I loved the beer sampler as I thought it really showcased the uniqueness of each one, and there were a few of them that almost tasted like wine but with that carbonated edge, which was surprisingly great!So where did it all go wrong?Well, what ended up happening was that I almost waited an hour for the poutine, and when I brought it up to the waitress she said she didn't remember me ordering it, and I explained that I ordered it with a different waitress. She went to the back to check it out, and about five minutes later, they messed up my order and gave me a regular poutine instead. I was quite irritated at this but I ate it anyway since I was in a rush and didn't want to wait any longer. The poutine itself was one of the better ones I've had in Montréal, but it still doesn't change the fact that at a seemingly unbusy time, the service was still slow and incompetent for such a simple order. The organization was bizarrely executed in a weird manner, and the only reason why I'm not giving less than 3 stars is because at least they didn't charge me for the price of the pulled pork poutine. Will I be back? Maybe, but I'd like the service to be more prompt and accurate, and I'm almost never one to complain about that specific criteria."

The only food we ever tried was the roasted rosemary nuts, which were super small but sort of a perfect energizer to keep us moving and only like $2.50 or something.The beer line-up is superb, and well-worth seeking out for that alone. Incredible and diverse selection. This was a winter visit so I can't speak to the outside space, but the front half of the place is drenched in sunlight if you time it right and a great place to warm up with on a cold day.The service was probably close to the slowest of all the places we visited in Montreal, but certainly friendly which was really all that mattered. We would have likely ordered food on our second visit, but could tell we would be there for quite a while trying to accomplish that so just decided to have our delicious beverages and keep on moving.I would just keep in mind this is a relaxing, friendly place and as long as you're not in a big hurry, it's pretty wonderful."

Poutine.Someone back in the kitchen could be curing cancer, but I'm glad their brilliance is focused on food, because this shit is actually one of the best ideas ever. With a touch more of the tangy BBQ sauce, it might even be the best food of all time, but I think at this point it's going to have to settle for being just ONE of the tastiest treats I've ever tasted.The crazy thing about Vices et Versa is that even if they didn't have pulled pork poutine on the menu it would still be an incredible bar, first and foremost because they have beers for DAYS. There are 33 on the tap list (that apparently rotates pretty frequently), and they are all locally brewed and judging by the four or five I was able to taste, all delicious. I guess I'm not well-versed enough in Quebec microbreweries to recall all of them, but I did have one brew called the Peche Mortal (mortal sin) that was dangerously tasty. And there was some kind of fiddle party going on in the back room.I'm moving to Montreal."

The place had a great atmosphere: cavernous, dark wood panels, dim lighting, and not too noisy considering how hopping it was. My friend and I are both fans of a less hoppy wheat beer, which doesn't seem to be very popular at the moment. I picked out #5, Wit L'Argousier, at the same moment our waitress pointed it out as one of their only wheat beers. Reminiscent of Hoegaarten, this light, carbonated, and citrusy beer was a wheat beer lover's dream.Knowing we'd be going out to dinner soon (where surely a bottle of wine was to follow), I choose to slowly nurse my Wit L'Argousier, but after draining his, my friend, thinking it would be similar to his last glass, ordered #19, the Hopfen Dunkeweizen. Although it had notes of pumpkin and cinnamon, it was super-hoppy, so not to my liking. Of course I'd like to see more of a draft wheat selection, but I can't expect Vices and Versa to cater to the few over the majority, now can I?"

Interesting avoidance tactic to say the least, one that I might have given her props for had my husband and I not had to bear the brunt of her awfulness.Eventually, she gave up on us altogether and two other (much happier) servers came around to our table to check on us.  At this point, the visit was a bust so we quickly finished our beers and left.  Bummer.  We left disappointed but eventually found our happy place at Dieu du Ciel later that night.So yeah.  A star for the beer.  A star for the two nice servers.  And, I don't know...maybe some mood-lifting tea for our server-turned-songstress?"

They were all delicious, my least favorite one being the ginger beer. My friend ordered a pizza for herself, it was perfectly sized for a single eater and tasted delicious (she was nice enough to give me a bite!). The server was accommodating, friendly, attentive, and helpful. I was especially impressed when he told my friend that her pizza had accidentally been overcooked and burned a little, so they were making her a brand new one. I commend and respect that very much because many places are more interested in your wallet than in your satisfaction.

We also had a cheese and charcuterie plate: interesting local cheeses, a flavorful country pate (maybe a version of creton?), warm bread and other good things.

Not what I was expecting nor wanting. I ate two bites only cause my first bite was a shock and made me wonder what I was actually eating. They had 32 selections of beer. I don't drink beer, but from what my friends said the beer seemed too watered down. You can get a tray with 6 flavours to try...out of the 6 my friends tried, they liked the one with ""Dubai"" in the name the best. The beer with ginger apparently had a very strong ginger taste, which is great if you like ginger.They have a water cooler where you can serve yourself, which I liked because I always drink water when drinking. The atmosphere was fine, nothing really special about the place. Service was pretty good, more so at the beginning, then it seemed not so great. The waitress came and one person ordered a drink and she didn't ask anyone else at our table if they wanted anything, which they did. A few minutes later my friend got up, went over to her while she was busy chit chatting with a coworker, and asked for a  drink.

The pub is more north on St. Laurent so i suggest taking the metro or a cab if your from out of town. Two key features that make the trek worth it - 1) best beer selection in Montreal and 2) cool laid back vibe.They had 33 beers on tap during my visit - all listed on the chalkboard with the brewer name & price. Beers were mostly $6.50 or $7 a pint.  All the  beers appeared to be from local Quebec brewers including: Dieu Du Ciel, Brasserie Dunham, Brasseurs du Monde, Charlevoix , le Trèfle Noir and at least 5-6 more.I joined my friends late so only had time for two pints so I went with the godly Dieu Du Ciel Peche Mortel and the Blanche du Paradis, also from Dieu Du Ciel. Next time I will try many more.  Servers were on the run the whole night, I think there was just two of them despite the full house. You had to waive one down to order your next pint which was a little frustrating. Like many of the other Montreal beer pubs, you can not run a tab.  Staff spoke English so no worries if your from out of town. Staff was friendly.Didn't try the food but the Belgium Fries, Bisson burger and poutine all looked amazingly good.

The servers are nice but the lack of consistent attentive service comes down to a failure on the part of management to consistently train personnel. Have patronized 10-20 times and I'd say about half of those was a pleasant experience where our server didn't give off the impression that it was a hassle to take our order, check in, or bus empty glasses.

/user_details?userid=vdNG3dQk-EQMo4AoP4DSxw,Vinny L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If you're a beer connoisseur then this place is for you. Quite a large beer menu for any discerning palate and a decent liquor selection as well. Inside was bigger than it let on from the street and it gets ""busy but never crowded...much."" You don't even have to shout to be heard across the table which is another good sign. So if you're looking for a good seat then get there early. A great casual hangout in the bar area but if you can score a table on the back patio then it's perfect for enjoying a brew with friends under the stars. Plus your date can watch the fireflies while you catch the basketball game going on right next to the patio: everyone wins.Otherwise, pretty good service and helpful. My first time there I asked for an amber lager and the bartender promptly gave me two samples to see what I liked more...or you can save some time by going to their website and look up whatever you fancy. Show up with the drink number or name and you're good to go otherwise you could be there awhile...going over your choices."
/user_details?userid=WX6Xv1uhnOSAZT2GWJvD8w,Herve E.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"With dozens of locally brewed beers on draft and above-average pub food, this place has a lot going for it. On a sunny day, you won't get a seat on the terrace unless you arrive unfashionably early. But if you have to stay inside, don't worry -- after 2 rounds of pale ale, you won't even notice the drab interior."
/user_details?userid=xRBnIhqYTJZcEA4-wuZ4uA,Dan G.,"Winthrop, MA",4 star rating,"What a fun place! The beer selection is pretty grand, I should have imbibed in those rather than my vodka sodas which were actually pretty good. They muddled the citrus  in the glass and it made almost like a boozy orangina but with lemon yummmm.Also, it seems that you have to be absolutely hot to work here. Every time I ordered drinks, looking into those blue eyes made me freaking forget what it was that I was here for derrrr.I enjoyed how accommodating they were when paying, you could easily get cash back if paying with a card. Why can't we do this here?!And lastly, the poutine we got here was probably one of the best that I've had during my short stay in Montreal.Je t'adore, MTL!"
/user_details?userid=Xpee0dZa7e3bEWyGZPFzRw,Vic F.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Beer lover's paradise!They had 34 beers on tap, including 2 cask selections. Place was jammed, but we were able to get a table (with a little help from the waitress). Fantastic beer selection that rivals some of our favorite bars in NYC.Great vibe - you feel like you are among locals of all different ages. Food looked & smelled good, though we didn't stray from the liquid course...Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!"

Nice.Cons- out of the way- mediocre to average service- uninspiring indoor ambianceWill def go back"

They even offer a sampler with 6 different  beers to try. You will also find fast foods in the menu,  poutines,  burgers fries etc... and they are descent. . Not sure if would return for the food,  but i will for the beer."
/user_details?userid=UeVG9bbjm7SEelcyoK2DHQ,Tom A.,"Ithaca, NY",4 star rating,"Of all the places I'd been in Montreal so far, this was the most modern, upscale and hipster. They did frites and beer very well. I love being able to get a glass of beer (as opposed to a pint) anywhere in the city, but hate the information design of the menus! Brewery first, then beer name, dammit! That said, the waitstaff was very friendly, quick and pleasant. I thought the selection here was less enamoring than Le Saint Bock, but still very nice to see a solid focus on the regional beers, if some prominent members were missing, in my opinion.A comfortable atmosphere, a good selection with appropriate serving temperature and glassware, paired with great frites and mayo made for an extremely pleasant early evening!"
/user_details?userid=eJvWbwv5AcNd-x-N_OjqNA,Chris H.,"Communauté-Urbaine-de-Montréal, Canada",5 star rating,"EXCELLENT! This is really one of my favorite bars in Montreal. Frites are actually really good but, of course, the real focus is on the diverse & extensive beer selection. Good music, outdoor space is fantastic to hang out in (weather permitting) and always a great crowd. It can be dangerous when dealing with the 8-12% alcohol beer range and a cozy seat. It's laid back but far from lazy!"

Take a (fairly long) stroll to Snacks'n'Blues afterwards for the late night DJ. That's where the music magic happens!Tip: Play a lil' game with your friends where you order by number. Tell your friends the number beforehand so they can tell you if it's something you DEFINITELY won't like. We did that and it led to some interesting tastings..."

We've been there several time and tried different ones (the menu also changes regularly so do go back!). The atmosphere is very laid-back, though the place is often very busy. And the food absolutely amazing! My only negative point would be the staff who are sometimes pushy and arrogant (no need to be, you'll get your tip don't worry!)"

/user_details?userid=IkxSyrN0ydtKy2DEmRSpVg,Tavish M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This place used to be better, now the staff act like V & V is the only game in town and it's your duty as a paying customer to put up with the slow and unfriendly service. It's true, they have a good selection of beers. Tonight it took me and my friend about 25 minutes to get one drink, OK, no problem, it's a busy Thursday night. We paid and tipped well. We finished that drink and our waiter was nowhere to be seen. Eventually a different server came by and we put in an order with her. 25 minutes later, still no drinks. We decided to give them 10 more minutes, then we would leave. As we got up to leave, our original waiter reappeared and asked if we were going outside for a smoke. No, I told him politely, we got tired of waiting, the service was unacceptable and we were leaving. He made up a story about seeing me walk out on a drink before. I said that was very interesting, he knows things about me that I don't even know myself--when was that? He said three years ago. I said he was the best waiter in the World if he could remember that--his talents were wasted at a joint like this. Whatever. The point is a real problem with the service came up and instead of apologizing and trying to make it right, our server got confrontational and made up a story about us being nuisance customers.Bottom line: You will really make your Vices et Versa server's day if choose to go somewhere else for a drink.  If you have to check this place out, go for an afternoon pint, don't waste your time on a busy evening."
/user_details?userid=ws8w3gzeKvdJ04vkKSiYvw,S H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"With 30+ beers on tap, including some really niche and innovative ones, this place was already in my good books. The giant terrasse out back is great on a summer evening. And the food is bistro fare prepared with panache, small-ish reasonable portions leaving more room for the beer. Chill atmosphere. Service on the slow side but friendly enough. Come for a nice leisurely night out with friends, and stay awhile."
/user_details?userid=JbgLgoy754EeQrWoQBLX1Q,Jenna M.,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"I went here last weekend for a birthday party and I felt like it was my birthday. What a sweet spot this place is...aside from the fact that it's just too far from my house! Why can't it be my own neighborhood ""Cheers"" bar?!  First of all, I love beer so the enormous selection was extremely tempting...I wanted to try them all, except tasting countless beers would inevitably lead to me falling off my bar stool. Been there, done that. Second of all, the music was excellent. I don't know who the DJ was, but I'd date his taste in music. My friends and I gathered up some tables and danced in our chairs until the wee hours. The ambiance of this place is where it's at! Brick walls, warm light, and chalk boards filled with the longest Christmas list of beers I've ever seen! Sadly, the patio was punched so we didn't get to hang out with the outdoor crowd. But, alas, there's always a next time...and there will be a next time...I can already hear the beer calling my name...or is that the DJ?"

If you're staying downtown you can grab a bus heading up St Laurent and get off in Little Italy. If it's warm enough try to grab a seat in the intimate back patio close to the extensive chalkboard beer list. My Montreal friends mentioned you can order a ""tasting"" of any 5 beers listed in a row. Whatever; just pick and choose. The IPAs were fantastic. Prices were very reasonable (~$6/pint)."
