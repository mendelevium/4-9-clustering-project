/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Sure it's a small physical spot (pretty much a walk-up window for take-out these days) and so you might simply pass by it. In that case you may need to rely on word-of-mouth or look out for their brown paper 'sandwich' bags in and around the area. Seems the place has a solid local following; those folks are in the know. I figured I'd grab one for lunch (they aren't open for dinner). They have a short but enough selection list of sandwiches. I was told by a few people and the counter person that the Big Naan was the one to go with for the first time round. It's a slight take on a Big Mac because of a similar sauce, you might imagine. The sauce was pretty good and the overall blend of flavors were tasty, but since I wasn't able to eat the sandwich while super fresh and warm the Naan bread got a bit chewy. Therefore, not as noteworthy as it might have been straight away. But, I still get why they've got the word-of-mouth going for them."

TINY!I walked in and the Capitaine switched from French to English at first sight (am I really that obvious?), greeting me warmly and offering up a postcard serving double duty as a menu. There were maybe half a dozen sandwiches on the regular menu plus another 3 specials. They all looked good so I mentioned it was my first time in and asked him to make something for me. He delivered a toasty and tasty Le Big Nan with a side of potato salad and an iced tea. The sandwich was simple but tasted great, I found myself wondering why I can't make a sandwich this good at home. There must be a secret. I like, but certainly don't love, potato salad. This one in particular was trying to warn me off with a healthy dose of fresh dill (I don't generally like dill). Hmm...it was excellent too. There was a steady stream of happy regulars grabbing sandwiches and chili to go in fact I bet this place is awesome in summer as a takeout option. Total tab with tax and tip was $15, about right for what was on the plate, but try to find a fast food lunch anywhere near as good for the same money! I'll be back."
/user_details?userid=vTbQZNz8FH4jcrni7Vkl1Q,Oleg H.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,Its a bold move to start a sandwich shop walking distance from some of the most legendary delis - in the world.Yet CS fearlessly challenges the competition and at least in my case delivers. The sandos we got were more snack than meal but the no line and nice outside seating gets Capitaine an extra star.

I wouldn't  have even noticed it unless it was reccomend to me, but it has the best sandwich i have had in a very long time. The menu is small, but what they have is excellent This is a place that is defivately worth going out of your eay for."
/user_details?userid=cX0Z3-xEDDad1nwYEfdDBw,Ilias B.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,This place serves hands down the most originaland tasty sandwiches I ever ate. Since my first visit. Theres not a week that goes by that i dont go get my fix;) The halloumi is my favorite but all the others are top notch too. A must for all sandwich lovers!
/user_details?userid=M0gkUA6Q092bzfebvEThGQ,Hannah W.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"A hidden gem!! Had the dejeunan sandwich and it was PERFECTLY cooked - wanted to take a picture but finished it too quickly - the egg was exceptional, cooked just enough that it wasn't a mess and still slightly runny. The naan was fresh and the flavours came together so beautifully. We just happened to be walking by and the owner wasn't even officially open but he accommodated us so nicely. PLEASE go visit capitaine sandwich! You won't be disappointed."
/user_details?userid=ZvcT92GJqOhu5dE5fkz3uA,Jen W.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Small sandwhich shop tucked away on Duluth street. I absolutely love their grilled haloumi sandwhich. It's the only thing I've ever ordered from there because they do it so well!
/user_details?userid=pEc3vD-mFTXhwq5B6eCZjA,Alexandra B.,"Boucherville, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is amazing. We weren't planning for it and walked by it, it smelt delicious so we went in. What a great decision :) I had the halloumi and my sister had the cubain sandwich and both were very good. If you have never been you need to stop here."
