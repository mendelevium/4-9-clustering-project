/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm happy that this place wasn't as bad as last time. I came for drinks just before the fire works it wasn't very packed but lots of bachelorette parties. The waiter we had was 2 weeks new and super friendly. The Service was quick and drinks were good minus the fact that they don't keep their vodka cold huge no no in my eyes.We asked to have a spot reserved at the bar so we could watch the fireworks and come back and of course they put up a little sign for us so our seats were they once we got back.They have a oyster bar until 11 pm that actually closed at 10:30. We got PEI pearl ones and they were really good not one bad one in the batch. We would of got more but they closed it down after our first 12.To get in you would use the street view door, after 11 they put a huge black curtain and you have to come in from the garbage side which I've never seen before, usually they use the side door that leads to the place easy access. When I came out I wasn't sure where I was but eventually figured it out.All and all it was great service the DJ was alright as well the place gets super cramped and you will be standing unless you buy a bottle."
/user_details?userid=ao7Jt5QoBWO15lGdZH16Kw,Christina T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"On Wednesday evening, I finally attended a conference I have been dying to attend for months. It is located a couple of minutes walk from the Places-d'armes station. The entrance is in the alley. When I got there, I was greeted into a beautiful dark room with dim lights setting everywhere. There were plenty of tables to chat around with the ladies and I sat at the back where I could see the frontal stage very clearly. The setting was small enough to be close enough from the speaker and the place was quite intimate to feel close to the storyteller. The food was a bit of a hit on some dishes and miss on others. I tried the hummus with pita bread and olive salads which were delicious and the flavors were not overpowering. Next, I tried the chicken called Karaage chicken. It is fried with a brown sauce in it. It was okay... I can't really tell what the brown sauce is... It is a bit sweet. On my side, I ordered the tacos chips with guacamole. I didn't like the chips since it was hurting my teeth but the guacamole was decent in taste. My drink of choice of that night was a Negroni, I didn't like it and they put too much ice and so little liquid for the price I paid. I didn't taste the orange as I like at another place in Montreal that makes a better negroni for half the price on a Friday as part of their special. Location wise, easy access to the metro. Food-wise, some are worth to try but the price is not for the faint of heart on this one. The conference, it was 5 stars. Oh... P.S the lady decided to tip herself 4$ from my overall food bill. I didn't know it could happen unless she was expecting me to be cheap with tipping."
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I never knew Joverse had a second floor! That looks like every other joint in old montreal. I have been here late nights and was never fond of the crowded lounge scene- the crowd is a mix of old and young. Ladies don't be surprised if you get turned away as a group of girls - it does happen ! I came here for a going away party and finger bites. I had the crab cakes (pretty filling - more like fish sticks then crab cakes) and homemade chips. The menu wasn't that diverse mostly just bar fast food. Good music though. This is not the place to catch up with friends over conversation-loud and dark !
/user_details?userid=A5UmPoM48Y8NOzMg7gjPuw,Natacha G.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Went there for supper with a few of my girlfriends on a friday.  The restaurant was surprisingly empty. It was us and 3 other tables, we were quite surprised. We ordered a few bottles of wine and we each ordered our mains. The food was quite mediocre. I remembered it to be much better than that. I wasn't impressed. Service was also quite slow. Even when it turned into a club later in the night it wasn't the best vibe."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It's a solid 3 stars. This is more of an after-work drinks bar than a restaurant. They have a dj and pretty cool decor and atmosphere. However, when it comes to food, I've definitely had better. Our group had a tasting menu, so we've tried almost everything on the menu. The portions are on a smaller side and the flavors are bland. The best thing on the menu that I remember is poutine and it was more like a 3,5 stars out of 5. The service is great though."

Good oysters from New Brunswick, really tasty champagne vinagret.The crab cakes were ok, the burger sliders decent and this tomato salad was very good looking."

/user_details?userid=PqI494Hy7C3hZIVaGpc2vg,Emy P.,"St-Bruno-de-Montarville, Canada",3 star rating,"This is a very cool bar with nice staff and ambiance.Great wine selection, private importations by the glass.Acadian salad, beef sliders, duck tacos and guacamole were good, nothing really special though, usual comfort food. Salad had a delicious dressing with fresh and crispy veggies (tomatoes, carrots, etc.), but beets were way too sour! Meat in beef sliders was tender, juicy and tasty. Simple but dope! Duck tacos (2) were too small but filled up with yummy ingredients. A bit of lime lacked in the guacamole mix. Milk chocolate jar was awesome, except the homemade coconut sorbet was a bit too hard on the tooth. Layers of chocolate cream, crumbles, raspberry jelly. Good flavors and textures. Overall service was fast and the staff very friendly. Food was good, but overpriced. I'd return there, but only for drinks."
/user_details?userid=FQIQvPG3u0DbeyAUWbGobQ,Summer S.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,Cool atmosphere and vibe. They were so accommodating with my vegan diet customizing their menu to make me options. The general tso cauliflower was so so good! They have a helpful staff and is a great place for either a romantic meal or to celebrate with your core group of friends.
/user_details?userid=eL8VdX4tyDr5zHWSahbtuQ,Courtney N.,"Wakefield, MA",3 star rating,"The entrance was down a short, dark alley through a door that seemed to lead into the back of the restaurant which was odd. Semi crowded on a Thursday night. We only went because it was a bit later and very cold and this was right down the street from our hotel.Items are overpriced for the amount you get. They're going for a Euro vibe but the food just doesn't match. The oysters were incredibly briny and salty. I tried the soup and it was just okay. I can't even remember what my partner had it was that memorable. Took forever to get our check. We had to ask three different people. It was just okay - there's many other better restaurants in the immediate area."

/user_details?userid=XGzPLsSMbE-mNoKroJlfxw,John B.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"I came here organizing a private dinner for a bachelor party from Chicago. Manny was extremely attentive and responsive during the process. The 8 course menu option as small plates was great and I thought a good value for a major city. Additionally, we had 17 people drinking for ~3 hours and again I thought our bill was fair. The food was passed small plates and a stand up dinner. Great way to go for our situation. Also, the service was fantastic so no idea what others are talking about. The music and vibe was hip but not over the top. My only regret is that we didn't stay for longer upstairs in the main room once we were done for my event. It was a highlight of our trip.The overall reviews don't do this place justice. Please sift through all of the reviews mentioning that the restaurant didn't serve them water from spring fed glacial run off or they wouldn't let their dog from their purse in."
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Strong cocktail bar with powerful cocktail drinks, these wonderful juleps still make me smile now in the morning. The other magic word is tacos, deliciously balanced combinations of multiple fresh ingredients, make sure to use the sauce from your serving board while eating the tacos, it matches perfectly the food. The guacamole was also nice, but not exceptional. Another sign of quality is the service, very professional, may be one the best I have seen in Montreal.Joverse has nice terrace for the summer days and once you need to migrate inside there are two floors with bars, where you can continue sipping your drink. As the terrace is closed the front door gets peculiarly locked with huge chain and blocked with piece of wood,  dark curtains fall over the windows and the bar suddenly gets this wonderful dimly lit athmospere. The very personal approach in the bathroom wins another smile.Must try!"
/user_details?userid=C2wX7kjtY9_9Y2NonQdhAQ,Ryan J.,"Syracuse, NY",5 star rating,"This was an excellent bar. We came here after our stop at Ristorante Quattro after our waitress suggested it for drinks. The atmosphere was great here. Dimly lit, but not too dark; a live DJ with music that wasn't overbearing; and a very friendly and attentive group of bartenders who were extremely generous to us. I tried the Mezcal Tequila at the suggestion of the bartender and wasn't disappointed. Though at $15 a glass I was only going to have one - but it was easily 2.5 shots in my glass. Later on the bartender gave us the leftovers of a shot he had made for another group (using the Mezcal), free of charge. The place was a great atmosphere and had a great drink selection. I'd highly recommend at least checking this place out for a drink if you're in the area."

The service was excellent.... after 11:30 they toss the tables so you can dance. The crowd is mostly over 28-29 ehich is great and the music is accordingly. The food was very good too... we had a beef slider and the poutine ! Worth to have a soirée there! ps: way better than Santos !

/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a nice cocktail bar in Old Montreal, and the Sailor Jerry and green tea cocktail is truly delicious. It looks a lot like other bars that have popped up recently with the same vintage raw bulb chandeliers, big wooden tables, metal, warm light, levels and space. It's a nice aesthetic, just feels a little copy paste maybe, but I'd rather we be copying this than other vibes more flourescent and plastic I guess. Higher up on the up side, the staff are nice, and good at what they do, and as my friend who should know pointed out, many look like male strippers. I think that means attractive and clean cut? I dunno. Do with that what you will."
/user_details?userid=-ShdX4pDKrldKfic9rHhSQ,Alex P.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"So this place is OK, seems fancy but it's younger than I expected. They make a good martini, and the guacamole plate is quite good? Overall with it! I came here with my wife and her colleague later in the evening (10pm). I guess its a lounge so they were about to morph in to a club lol, there was a lot of security, wonder what sort of crowd they attract?"

I wanted to see her so I went along with my wife at around 11pm for drinks etc.Totally not my vibe of a place. Loud bad remixes of songs and eurotrashy decor, gold digger girls and international students with too much of Dad's money to piss away in some kind of weird Diesel commercial themed egofest. But the drinks were good and strong (though a tad pricey), and service generally nice for this kind of place. Some people would like this, but I'll never for the life of me understand what the attraction is to these kinds of places. Though it may be different if you go earlier for food more etc, not sure."

/user_details?userid=h1UcaSPIPpQqMiWf12Csqw,Jill M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Very mediocre place.  I was expecting more and I was highly disappointed. I ordered a cosmo for 11$ and it didn't even come in a martini glass it was in a much smaller cup. I then had the crab cakes which barely had any crab meat inside and was mostly just batter. The beer batter shrimp tacos were not battered at all and we're very soggy. Also, normally when you go out for someone's birthday they give a free dessert.  Here they had the nerve to charge me the 6$ churros for my friends birthday. Everything is tapas style and extremely small for the price.  I don't recommend going here if you are on a budget and very hungry.  I'll pass next time."

The person I dealt with through email was extremely nice. Friendly, on the ball, gave me all the information I needed. I have no complaints there.The place itself is a small place, super cute. Now the problem lies in the staff. I'm not sure if our waiters were new but there seemed to be a lot of confusion when it came to ordering drinks. They had ran out of most of the white wine. They mixed up our drinks on numerous occasions and the drinks themselves were extremely watered down. That's where the disappointment comes in. The drinks were not cheap at all. But for the price that you paid, I wanted to taste something other than water and olive juice.The food itself was good. I wouldn't say anything more than good. For the cost, I was expecting something more to be honest with you.Given the opportunity, I would have preferred going back to La Champagnerie. It costs the same but the drinks will knock your socks off and the food portions and taste is better in my opinion."

SO MUCH FUN!I definitely recommend you check it out if you're ever in the Old Montreal area."
/user_details?userid=ZX-mXfVnllAYcFFCkQMR7g,Hassan A.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,The place is decent sized. We went there for my cousin's birthday and were there till 3am until they finally kicked us all out. Stairs to the washroom were a bit of a hassle but the service at the bar was good and the music was great (I lost it when he played Bon Jovi at 3am) Interesting back alley for a quick smoke.
/user_details?userid=eF5B8DADR5zVtIRBqJlwXg,Pavel G.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Joverse is a great spot in Old Montreal. The presentation jumps at you as soon as you enter with their DJ playing great evening house music setting up the lounge vibe as you take in the well lit decor -- an intelligent mix of wood and steel arranged against the brick wall background.The food is fantastic -- all tapas style. Well priced and quickly served by a very friendly staff with a full evening crowd, which was a very good looking mix.We were in a group of four and shared about 8 items.The mushroom plate is delicious! The slider is phenomenal and the beef tartare is great too. Overall presentation, flavour, and service was top shelf.On top of this, they run an awesome bar downstairs called the Red Room which is big enough for about 50 people and is perfect for a house music filled night right after dinner."

If you are more than 10 people they will take your credit card to hold the reservation. The place is pretty loud.It's a happening party spot. Great atmosphere. Lots of birthday groups and bachelorette groups. I got the fish tacos. It's really delicious. I tried my friend's tartar d'hanachi and it was also a great option. But the food are tapas sized portions so as long as you come not too hungry. The Coconut Cream drink is really good and not creamy. The service was good. They are a little quick to clean up after you and pick up your drinks and plate even before you're done. After it turns into a club with amazing music and dancing!

I gave Joverse another try last night despite my last experience being really unimpressive. Guess what? IT WAS WORSE. This time we didn't even get a drink order in. There was no one in the place. Not one patron besides us. My friend and I sit down, no one comes to see us. I walk to the bar and ask for menus. Despite being the only patron in the bar, I wasn't greeted. The bartender stood there looking at me like I just walked into the place with no pants on. I assure you, I had pants on. I asked him for a menu, he said he'd bring us some. I go to use the restroom (which was an absolute horror show by the way - there is no excuse for your toilets to be filthy at 5pm other than your disgusting, slovenly practice or lack thereof in cleaning them - and I am talking backed up toilettes covered in excrement and urine - empty soap dispensers - dirty floors) and by the time I came back my friend had 1 menu but whatever, we can share.

/user_details?userid=rgEfkvD97yy--e7m3AZJbw,Paige S.,"Laval, Canada",1 star rating,"Terrible experience at this place on Saturday. I reserved three weeks in advance and the reservation process went mostly smoothly, except I had to ask twice for a price list for bottle service and after asking twice for this service, I was told that a group would be taking over half of our table at midnight. I then had to again tell them that I wanted my table as I was planning on getting bottle service too. At this point, the person organizing my party said that wouldn't be a problem in that case.When we got to Joverse, no one greeted us at the door, and we literally waited 20 mins before any one asked if what we were waiting for. During this time, no one that worked there even came to the door area so that we could even ask for assistance. Finally, after greeting us, they made us wait another 10 minutes while they cleaned our table. Our reservation had been at 9:30 so our table should have been clean by then and waiting for us, but it wasn't even clean by 9:50 when we finally found someone.Our waiter was very nice, however the drinks took over 20 minutes to come, and when our food started coming out, the runners did not know what food belonged to who, and a lot of my guests did not get the correct plate. The prices were normal, the the drinks were good, the food was good (but also very greasy) and there was only one salad as a vegetarian option. At 11:30, we were ready to order our bottle service, so we did, however by 12:30, we still hadn't been served our bottle. During the entire hour, not one person working at Joverse came to our table. Eventually, another server (or maybe manager?) came to tell us that a group that had ordered more bottles than us was taking over our table. We explained that we had been here for hours, and had reserved our table 3 weeks in advance for the whole night, mentioning we wanted dinner and bottle service, but they didn't care. We were moved to a tiny table (our group had 12 people), but on the bright side they finally brought our bottle. Again, another mistake here though, since they brought Kettle One, rather than the Grey Goose that I had ordered. About 5 minutes after they dropped off the correct bottle, our old server mysteriously appeared, wanting to be paid in full for the bottle immediately, and ''apologized'' for disappearing for so long. Overall, probably one of the worst experience I've ever had at a bar. The ""bottle service"" was not service at all, and was an embarrassment on their part. By the end of the night, my friends were angry, sober, and the night was basically ruined, and Joverse lost money as we had originally intended to buy several bottles, but decided against it based on our experience with the first."

Also, after explaining a food allergy in detail to the waitress multiple times (and calling in advance to explain the allergy), she still brought me both my appetizer and my meal slathered in sauces made of what I am allergic to, which is highly frustrating. Also, no cutlery on the table and not enough napkins. As someone else wrote earlier, the person I spoke to on the phone/manager/maitre'd was very kind and accommodating and told me they take allergies seriously and I believe he tries, but he needs to teach his staff the importance of following through on this and taking it seriously. My waitress was practically yawning and rolling her eyes as I tried to explain this to her... If it weren't for that I'd have given a better review... And, they don't serve tea or coffee, no hot drinks, what Resto doesn't serve tea or coffee with dessert after the end of a meal?"
/user_details?userid=6r0xv6AACgtl2c5_IzBr0Q,RK K.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"I would have to give this restaurant a 3 star only because we had an excellent waitress! The food is really average (Ottawa offers MUCH better restaurants!!) and the drinks were nothing exceptional. I went there for a bachelorette party with 14 guests, ordered the entire menu several times over, and ordered bottle service. Our bill was not cheap! Instead of being welcomed in the restaurant, the snooty manager came to our table 3 TIMES, ordering us to be quiet or she will force us to leave!! Unbelievable! The whole place was loud and there was another bachelorette party, a bachelor party and a bunch of guys watching a hockey game! I even noticed her behaviour around the restaurant where she would walk around like a principle in a school checking on her students doing their homework! The average age of the place is in the 30's so where exactly does she think she is!?The DJ was also extremely snooty and unpleasant, and played the same tunes over and over again, even when the place turned into a ""club"". Honestly, not worth a trip to Montreal and would definitely not come back again!"
