Fairly priced, al dente and savoury dishes- and you are going to complain about that? Give me a break.Under Le Club Chasse et Pêche, Le Filet and Le Serpent, the most charming sibling Il Miglio was born on June 16, 2017. Il Miglio is a casual Italian restaurant that focuses mainly on the surrounding offices, but that won't stop me from making a pit stop. They have 2 locations: Plateau Mont-Royal and Griffintown. If you have some time to spare and want quality lunch without breaking the bank, Il Miglio is truly the way to go. Their establishment consist of daily fresh pasta. That's right, if the only thing you know is Catelli or Barilla, you're truly missing out on the art of savouring fresh pasta.Whoever told you that carbs aren't good for you haven't spent enough time at Il Miglio. Campanelle served with mushroom and truffle.I'm telling you, Italian is the only way to go.Besides Moccione, I think Il Miglio truly stole my heart. Al dente mafaldine amatricana with a glass of wine during lunchtime is truly the only way to go. Go see Francesco and his staff at the Griffintown location and you'll know exactly why I'm raving about this place.The only thing that truly breaks my heart is that their location isn't open on weekends."

I am in a constant state of craving pasta and there aren't many options around my work so this place was much-needed. A full, satsifying pasta meal for a casual lunch price. My Italian friend told me that all the Italians were saying it was good (and they are quite picky) so I was excited to try it. Because it was my first time the man cooking said I had to have Campanelle with mushrooms and truffle so of course I got that and it was perfect. The sauce was smooth, perfectly flavored and stuck to the pasta very well and there were tons of mushrooms. My friend didn't know what cannelloni was and the man working the cash register said he could try it and he ended up giving us an entire dish of two cannelloni. Also so good. Perfect filling. Although we ate a lot on this trip because it was our first time, just one dish would have been enough for an ordinary day. They also have a few desserts in their refrigerated area that I'd like to try, I heard the tiramisu was good. The space is really bright and the people were super nice. It's been less than a week and I already want to go back and try everything else on their menu."

Really affordable and high quality, plus their 3-6 special of a pasta and a drink for....10$! Is amazing. It's a rare treat and overall exceptional when a place goes the extra mile to make you feel like you spent your money well, as opposed to all the other places where you leave with a pit in your wallet and sadness in your stomache.Support this place! 5 stars from me"
