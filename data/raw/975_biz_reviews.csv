We arrived around 6 and were able to order from the table d'hôtes menu ($ 45 tx excl.).This restaurant is a bring your own wine, so we brought  a whole case of wine with us. I ordered the fish soup as a starter, a treat. Then, I took the beef scotfer, again very good. I finished with the lemon and raspberry dessert.The service was courteous and fast despite our large group (13), I will come back for sure."

She had once mentioned having a great xmas party experience at Restaurant Wellington in Verdun. I had yet to go and the restaurant is perfectly halfway between my place in the Pointe and my sister's in Verdun. So after a short apéro at my sister's, we found ourselves at Wellington a few weeks ago for a nice meal to celebrate prior to the Holidays starting up.Restaurant Wellington has been around for 7 years now and has developed a solid reputation as a BYOW restaurant. It hits many of the classic tropes you see in the more successful BYOWs in Montreal - simple, clean decor, blackboard menus and a menu that is French in technique but that works with as much local produce as possible. Service was solid through the evening. It was a quiet Sunday night so ambience wise it was very relaxed and low key. For the appetizer course, I went with the beef tartare served with egg yolk, caramelized onions, dried mushrooms and crispy crackers. A classic but well executed and well presented. I loved the textural element that the dried mushrooms brought by being mixed in with the meat. The yolk and the onions provided the classic sweet and rich notes that pair well with the raw beef.As a main, I got to try two different ones by sharing with my wife. I went with the Quebec pork belly braised in local beer Botanik by 4 Origines served with cortland apples, Brussel sprouts, mustard and maple sauce. I love a good fatty pork belly and this one was no exception. Botanik is a very herbal beer with strong gin-like notes and I enjoyed how those flavours came through with the pork. All of the sides were very done and paired nicely to the main element. An excellent dish.My wife had chosen the seared scallops served with roasted garlic polenta, zucchini, parmesan, eggplant and burnt thym sauce for her dish. Scallops were delicious and seared nicely. The really unique element was the polenta and how the roasted garlic really popped and mixed nicely with the cheese melted on top as well. A solid dish.The final course was dessert and I went with the brownie served with various additions including a spice cream which was excellent - very holiday in spirit. The brownie had a great texture and very chocolately flavour. A solid finish for the meal.Restaurant Wellington is a solid BYOW option through and through. We left happy and satisfied with our meal. On this occasion, my mother was happy and that was the most important thing. If you are looking for a good BYOW in the Sud-ouest, Wellington is definitely worth your consideration. They will not disappoint you.Cheers!"

Every single item was extremely delicious, except maybe for the amuse-bouche which was part of the 5 course meal, which was just a risotto ball with light green sauce, which was decent but not amazing, but who cares that item only has $3 value anyway, but every thing else I tastes was over the top. We all got the 5 course meal, and also shared a charcuterie. Avg for a 5 course meal is $50-$60. I had the scallops- so so good and tender. The pate and smoked duck from the charcuterie were amazing. Desserts were also good and special. Great cute cozy classy atmosphere, superior service. And of course, nothing is cooler than byob. 5-star rating for a true 5-star resto- well deserving."

The flavours and plating was exceptional.Only thing I would change is have the starter of foie gras bigger as the tiny sliver was not big enough.We had a few bottles one was champagne and we weren't offered flutes even tho I saw a table with some while walking to the bathroom.Service was nice. Extremely busy place but what else would you expect it's the holidays. 35,45,55 are the dinner course options 3 course, 4 course or 5 course.Soup wasn't really worth it ( mouthful of a fancy pea soup)"

The refined plates were beautifully presented, and the market fresh selection of Quebec foods was delectable and delicious! The service was attentive and the vibe was casual and lively; surely on my go to list for a relaxed evening with friends!"
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",3 star rating,"The return was a litlte less starry, sadly. Definitely some highlights - the salmon ball I was given at the start of the 5 service table d'hote was delicious and I would happily order ""Salmon Balls"" as a main any time they might choose to allow it. The soup aux courge with the fried, breaded cheese ball and bit of crunchy lardon floating at the bottom was perfect, point finale. The Trou Norman palate cleanser (mojito ice) was bangingly boozey and yummy, and I really loved my pain perdu dessert, amazing hot and crispy and dripping with tire a l'erable ice cream. For the main I ordered the bavette, and while I was enjoying the flavour and cut of the meat the anchovy butter melted, got everywhere, and completely overpowered the flavour. It was a cloying bad taste that put me off the rest of the plate and was a shame. The server was charming, friendly and sweet but forgot to mention that they were out of the mussels,  or that the bavette was going to come with green beans instead of the kale choux on the menu (the menu is on a chalkboard, why not just update it?) More to the point, they seemed to be under-staffed on the floor and in the kitchen, our meal took 3 hours - too long on a Monday night with only four other tables. This included us asking for our bills with dessert. I'd try it again, but am not in a rush to go back with so many other tasty places in town to try, and the taste of that anchovy butter still lurking in my mind."
/user_details?userid=b3r6cl8hyujfLG2yo8qtBA,Maria P.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"As far as I'm concerned this is as good as it gets!  Went with a little group. Service, was personal and professional and very attentive. Food was fresh, so fresh they had to change one of the entrees according to what they found at the market fresh. Food was amazing.  The restaurant was charmingly decorated and it was easy for our group to actually have a nice conversation while drinking and enjoying the fine food. For a BYOB this is one of the more expensive ones but so worth the experience!  :-)"
/user_details?userid=ImxjzH7dcN9RLSNNneM2xA,Antonin J.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,Small cozy restaurant. Excellent food and great choice. Friendly staff with clear explanations of the menu. BYOW so if you add this to the rest it is one of the best choice you can make.I would recommend to take the 5 services menu which gives you a good idea of the quality of the food and is not too pricey
/user_details?userid=W57Wky4n46vUdrodKpaumQ,M W.,"Canandaigua, NY",5 star rating,"We had an excellent meal with great service. Save room for desert, the three we had at our table were all outstanding. The beef tartare, duck and salmon were great. Not sure if it was a language misunderstanding but the salmon is smoked but served raw. It was delicious but not what we were expecting. The lamb was also wonderful. So tender ,served with onion rings, kale, carrots and chick peas ( not my favorite but tasty.) Enjoy the casual atmosphere and great service."
/user_details?userid=QuCqhTW3oaFw2Zl_oaujVQ,Melissa S.,"Grafton, Canada",5 star rating,"Came here last night for the 8:30 round of service with my family of fancy eaters from London and we were all very satisfied! Some of us tried the delicious 5 course meal for 50-60$. The food is worth the expensive price. Every item was delicious! The portions for the appetizers are quite small but the mains and desserts were plentiful. Also, how else are you going to get through 5 courses and enjoy each one if they are all huge portions? It was perfectly balanced and I left extremely full and satisfied. Best part? BYOB so you can have a fancy and boozy night out without breaking the bank. We interacted with two waitresses who were both very polite, knowledgeable and attentive. They went above and beyond for us, explaining the meals in both french and english for my London family even though we were in Verdun. Plating was stunning and ingredients were carefully thought out. Balance of flavour was impeccable. We will definitely go back!"
/user_details?userid=mHW8RaOu3BCw8YMTnLKcVA,Steve K.,"Hudson, Canada",5 star rating,"Went on a Saturday night could only get an 8:30 reservation (call before Friday). At 8:30 it was still packed. Much larger than we thought but tastefully decorated and comfortable, the atmosphere is good and upbeat ( a little loud but not terrible ).The menu is not huge but has some very interesting dishes, after some great service and advice from our server we opted for the red snapper and veal liver mains along with spinach salad and blood pudding starters. We also opted for the table de hote which added desert, amuse bouche and an amazing rhubarb sherbet. Simply put all courses were excellent!! The liver was the best I have had , tender and extremely tasty. In addition, the portions were generous and we left full and happy. The service is way above good . Our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu, and very pleasant. Again a restaurant in Verdun comes through with exceptional service ( side note: we have been to a number of places in Verdun and the service is always exceptional)As a byow, it is not the cheapest, but the combination of food and service make this a must go destination. We will definitely be returning."

Great BYOB in Verdun, awesome quality and service.The formula is very affordable - around 50$ for s 5-course dinner.I will be back, again and again. And you should, too! Even if you don't live in Verdun."
/user_details?userid=lyjQt-SG7lkkGs0qzbivgw,Linda A.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"We had a very delightful experience at Wellington. Even though there was only one server, we felt very well taken care of. Our meal and service exceeded expectations."
/user_details?userid=NyG9fjwGThi_p9-HsFX1Hg,Vincent F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4 star rating,"A group of us came in for dinner last night and we were all generally happy with the whole experience. The seasoning was a little heavy handed at times but for the most part quite enjoyable.There was one thing during the evening that as a chef and a restauranteur myself, I felt a little pretentious. One person in our group asked that the duck be served a little more cooked than the medium rare the chef suggested. The server said that the chef would not serve the duck cooked to her desired temperature and that perhaps something else on the menu would suit her better. They were not being unreasonable and asking for it to be well done or anything - they just wanted it pink... Instead they ordered a lesser item on the menu and were really disappointed because they were looking forward to the duck dish. I guess my point is as restauranteurs we are there to create the most memorable experience for the guest. Having them wanting to come back time and time again. After all it's a business and instead of this particular guest talking about how great the restaurant was and telling lots of people about her exceptional experience, they leave feeling a little under whelmed. I remember a chef of mine when I was just a young commis telling me that if a guest wants grilled red pepper diamonds we are going to we are going to make them the BEST red pepper diamonds they are going to have. Ultimately we have a laugh about it at the same time. It is what it is.  Here is a quote I read in an article with Thomas Keller that inspired me to write this review""It's like walking into an Italian restaurant and they can't split a bowl of pasta, which is the easiest thing in the world to split. If you can take your ego out of it, you can do anything the guest wants.""All in all a good experience and am looking forward to going back - just something for the chef to think about. In my humble opinion anyways."

/user_details?userid=70znbsCXXK9yLnY2EPNF2A,Mark C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"As part-time residents of Montreal, we had the pleasure of introducing friends who've lived in Montreal their entire adult lives to this restaurant. It was an evening of great food, great service and friendship. The menu is diverse and every course is a delight. On our most recent visit, my wife had the beet salad and I had the marinated salmon and we both had the duck magret for our main plate. There's a special price on the tasting available Sunday-Thursday that's a nice bargain if you want a multi-course meal. Wellington is one of our favorite aportez bistros/restaurants in all of Montreal. Worth a trip to Verdun. Just be mindful that parking can be a challenge."

One member of our party was a half hour late, but the staff were very understanding, they made us acharcuterie platter to keep us occupied while we waited. The food was superb. Itwas one of the best meals we had in a long time. We will definitely go there again.Harold B."

Excellent service, the waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the preparation of each item (and we came on the first night of the new menu). Warm, relaxed ambiance yet not stuffy. Nice spot for a date. Had the table d'hôte, well worth it!"
