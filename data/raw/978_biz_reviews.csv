Go and check this boutique cafe.  The coffee is real good. And the walk in the young neighborhood makes your coffee even better"
/user_details?userid=DD4KCmjAdJiJfv6yJcb4Uw,Virginia L.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Very cool nook in Griffintown. The café also presents as a mini gallery with local artists. So while you are hanging out waiting for your coffee you have beautiful art pieces to discover and/or buy. I really appreciated the mezzanine. You can walk up a spiral staircase and set yourself up on the large table hidden there. I can imagine that this is a great spot to do some serious work. Will be back when I am back in the neighbourhood. The coffee was excellent as well.

They have a wide range of no dairy milks as well as vegan and gluten free sweets that are freshly baked. The service is excellent. There's a bunch of seats if you wish to stay and you can bring your laptop if you wish, just don't go overboard and stay more than 2 hours."
/user_details?userid=iVXISIgh-unsJz57-qOHTQ,Sheryl L.,"Candiac, Canada",5 star rating,"Super cute little cafe smack in the middle of Griffintown. The owner/barista is very sweet and very welcoming.This little cafe is filled with a beautiful white spiral stair case and amazing art work. There is an art gallery inside and they also sell some locally made symbolic bracelets. Everything on the menu is reasonable and affordable. They cater to any dietary need (soy milk,almond milk etc) I ordered a medium hot chocolate. It was nice to see that they use real Lindt chocolates when making a hot chocolate,rather than powdered chocolate. The owner miscalculated the amount of milk that was needed for my drink so instead of charging me for a medium she said she would charge me for a small. Little things like that is what makes this cafe great. Shows the owner is honest and cares about customer satisfaction. Its refreshing.Its a small cafe but in a great location,next to some great restaurants and montreal's finest butcher.If you're in the neighbourhood I definitely recommend stopping by for a drink, or just a look at the art. Im am definitely going back!"

Made a quick stop here with some friends while trying to kill some time before heading down to Birdbar which is down the street. The owner, I assume, was very pleasant and really seemed to take pride in her shop. I would definitely revisit if I was in Canada simply to look at the art alone."
/user_details?userid=Db7ZYVGvt0XJZiDNm_NhfA,Juju Y.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,Simply delightful. This is the best coffee quality in the area. I love their light roast but also their tea selection. Their matcha is great. They have a great selection of non dairy milk and breakfast foods. You must have one of their almond croissant because it is epic. Don't forget to look at the artwork and gift area because that selection is really delicately and mindfully selected. I love this spot.
/user_details?userid=4U2lsl2jKZ7RDOVBN28qQw,Monica I.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Cafe Lali is a lovely little cafe near Griffintown with an art gallery, great coffee roast ( I prefer the light one) , varied selection of pastries and very welcoming staff. The seating area at the upper floor is a bit more intimate than the lower one and in summer they have a small terasse out front. The biggest plus apart from the coffee and the artsy vibe - for me at least - is that they are dog friendly too. I can grab coffee with doggo in the morning without worrying where to leave the dog ( and without bothering anyone) - and the very sweet cafe owner will always offer a dog treat while we wait for my order to be ready. We (human and doggo) both love the place!"
/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The MOST ARTSY café in town! In fact it is a two-in-one: Café and gallery. Pieces of artwork of different artists are showcased here and this lovely café really let your imagination go wild! I love how quiet and bright it is, perfect to study and read a good book. They also offer a variety of art books (JPGauthier, Dali, Impressionists) to consult for free! Their coffee is also very good, I tried the filter coffee, even though I would have liked it a bit richer, the balance of the berries and jasmin taste of the coffee was great! The owner is super nice and respectful, I simply love this café!"

/user_details?userid=z8ckRjVaLQWAFaqKFwaodA,Emilie W.,"Seattle, WA",3 star rating,"Lovely cafe with an excellent latte, but had to drop one star because I found a hair stuck in my almond chocolate pastry, and that completely turned off my appetite."
/user_details?userid=z3bHy4MykD9bgmuzgGsNDg,Jenny P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I passed by and found this unbelievable place. It's like studying in gorgeous art gallery.I immediately fell in love with the place after one visit. The service was absolutely great and coffee was fresh. I'd keep on coming here and recommend it to all.
/user_details?userid=WgdozIRyj5St8VQ9it-j5A,Stuart A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Not bad Americano. The dark roast is far worse than the light. Though they may change their beans so that's not a gurmarantee. When it's good it is great, when it's not, it's pretty bad. Consistency is the problem."
