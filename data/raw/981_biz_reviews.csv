From the outside decorations and setup, I always assumed that this was an one stop type of pizza parlor. I am glad to say that I was completely wrong. We visited Toro, because it was one of the few actual restaurants that was open for dinner on Christmas Day. We ordered the Prix Fix meal, which was around 24 bucks (CAD), and it came with 4 courses, which included dessert. My salmon with a creme sauce was perfectly prepared. To be perfectly honest, I cannot remember the rest of the courses but the food was definitely edible (I do not remember complaining about anything). Although the food did not have that 100% authentic Italian feel, the food was definitely better than many so-called authentic Italian restaurants in New York City. The service was very exceptional. Our waiter was nice, helpful and really funny. He was very good in explaining many of the items that were on the special menu, which were in Italian and French. I am a little suprised that this place has received so many bad reviews in regards to the service. I would definitely eat here during another visit in Montreal."

I had it with my favourite puttanesca sauce although it wasn't anything special. They serve food until midnight and the service was great.

Ordered the Gigi, rigatoni in bolognese and the mussels. Everything came out promptly and tasted delicious! Also the staff we encountered were very pleasant and we had nice conversation with the waiter. No complaints, would definitely return if in the area again."

Especially lone travelers!Server(s) roofied my drink when I went to the bathroom.I came back and my sangria had a grainy white substance in the bottom that tasted like crushed aspirin. I don't know what they put in it, but I wasn't going to continue drinking it, and the server noticed. They don't have name tags and they don't print the waiter's names on the receipt, but if you're eating alone, steer clear of this place.The food was meh."

/user_details?userid=lsSzieGFg6Fiun0DmrDThQ,Ken W.,"New Haven, CT",4 star rating,"Pleasant  setting  in the Village. Room is done tastefully in red and black, with ceramic figures of bulls placed here and there.  Bar and an open kitchen are located toward the back of of the room. Soft jazz played in the background. Service was efficient and friendly. My meal was enjoyable throughout. Shortly after I was seated, my server brought a complimentary slice of bruschetta, my first clue that despite the red, and the black, and the bulls, this restaurant was more Italian than Spanish. I ordered from the table d'hôte menu, where soup/salad, entree, and coffee/tea range from  $10.95 - $18.95.  It would be hard to find a better deal in this part of Montreal, probably why locals seemed to outnumber tourists. The salad consisted only of romaine with a slice of tomato but it was very fresh, and the lemon viniagrette was outstanding. I added a starter of escargot forestiere which was just OK. My entree, coquille St Jacques, consisted of a ceramic casserole filled with scallops   (and shrimp) baked with Gruyere, with mashed potato piped around the edge. It was one of the best I've had. Dessert was not included, but when I saw the tiramisu flying by, I had to have it. Once again, it exceeded my expectations.If you choose to dine at Toro Rosso, don't expect trendy cuisine or pretentious service. It's classic food in a comfortable setting. I look forward to coming back whenever I'm in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=uv_iTkCLpUvEjzO8Pxt1Mg,Paul D.,"Lynbrook, NY",4 star rating,Service fast and attentive. Waiter had no problem conversing with us in English and without attitude. My wife had a flank steak with fries.  I had the veal Parmesan with linguini and my son requested a plain personal pizza which was not on the menu but they prepared for him.  Food was good.  Wife had a chocolate raspberry cake for desert.  Patio dining

/user_details?userid=1qa2Ui6_pt_N5O182BiExg,Albert H.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"The waitress was very friendly, but the food was definitely disappointing. The place was empty and no wonder, the calamari was old and not cooked properly, super rubbery. It's definitely one of those places that don't even try cause they can get away with just trapping tourists from a very busy street. Please avoid completely!"
