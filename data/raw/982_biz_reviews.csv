/user_details?userid=IzJ36jX6V6ky5BtoN-Agng,Chun P.,"San Diego, CA",4 star rating,"This is a tough one...We were kindly greeted by a friendly, handsome gentleman whom also was our server. We took a nice window table inside the warm wooden and beautiful brick interior. Jazz was playing in the background. This all gave Rebel and delightful upscale atmosphere...Unfortunately, while the food was good, it wasn't extraordinary. This is probably just fine if you're a local seeking some comfort food in an enticing atmosphere, but if you're a foodie tourist like me, you're probably seeking some a bit more...$15 half dozen oysters...these were fresh and ginormous!$23 Grilled Seabass...cooked well with a thick rich gravy, but nothing complex. The steamed veggies and mashed potatoes...bland.$28 Steak Frites...cooked nicely at medium. Good, but not thrilling.  As were the accompanying frites.  $35 Bottle of good red wine, Parallele 45. Montreal's gayborhood has few elegant sit down eateries, but Rebel makes a decent meal in a lovely setting."
/user_details?userid=lopUI4MAQkTvd732iULi-A,Stijn S.,"AN, Belgium",1 star rating,"This place is a tourist trap.Due to ""the current situation"" the menu is limited to only a few dishes, which is understandable. The only strange thing is that these meals are incredibly simple but still have a ""premium"" price tag. My partner and myself therefore just ordered a burger with fries. The fries were nice, but too few. The burger clearly came from the freezer and was far too dry. Also the buns were dry.Out of courtesy I still left a 10% tip, but the waiter was not having it and was incredibly rude. He then proceeded with convincing me that the minimum tip that I should give is 15%, otherwise he even ""lost money"" on serving us. He then took out his card machine again and made me pay another amount just as the tip, which he conveniently rounded off to 20%.In total I payed over 70 CAD for 2 burgers with a few fries. Avoid this place."

/user_details?userid=goCJuWZC7lg3GfhCfaE8KA,Joey S.,"Asbury Park, NJ",4 star rating,We stopped here last night looking for a late dinner but got a great meal instead.  The waiter and chef were charming and helpful.  My companions enjoyed the rack of lamb the most.  My burger was excellent.  Make sure you leave room for the cheesecake topped with maple popcorn.  (I was skeptical but they totally work together).

Had the lamb shank this time and the duck confit sandwich the first time. My server, Thomas, was welcoming and spoke excellent fluent English which was helpful."
/user_details?userid=v0KmYNybWmLXDZdL5BcKug,Vic G.,"Quincy, MA",5 star rating,"What a fantastic place to have brunch or any meal for that matter. I was very impressed with my maiden visit to Rebel and the wonderful late afternoon brunch that we had this past weekend. This place came on tops in every aspect. Ambiance:What can beat sitting outside on a balmy summer afternoon, under the shade of the umbrella, watching the world go by (in this case the very mixed and yet very interesting crowd one gets to watch on Rue Saint Catherine)? That is exactly what we did. Although, they have an equally impressive indoor space with a very modern design and definitely a very cool vibe. The tables outside are placed for couples' seating but can be quickly combined for a bigger group.Food:The menu is quite extensive. And the brunch omelets being served in cast iron dishes seemed really appealing. So we went for the same, And some mimosas to begin the afternoon. The french bread served with butter in a small covered bottle was really good.  And the omelet was definitely the best part. Right out of the oven, the hot cast iron dish kept the omelet warm for a long long time. Fluffy and perfectly done, all the ingredients were cooked to perfection. The potatoes on the side were done right as well. Couldn't have asked for a better meal. I had to gulp down my mimosa rather quickly as it all of a sudden became sweltering hot mid way through our already warm meal. No complains though :)Service:Top notch. Everyone was very nice and polite and there wasn't a time when we felt there was either too little or too much attention being given - to us or to any of the guests. It was just the right balance. Our waiter was sure to check upon us that everything was good and up to the mark. Really nice set of people working here.Overall, this place is one of the best places that I ate at during our very short but so much fun long weekend here in Montreal. These guys know how to run a good show and hope they keep up the excellent gig going till we visit again!"
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",3 star rating,"I feel like the general consensus for me for this restaurant is sort just not amazing but not bad. They had some good points : nice well made sangria (a few different types) , their outdoor patio was spacious and comfortable and perfect for a warm summer night (but no umbrellas in case of too much sun or in case of rain though). Service was quick and attentive and our waitress was so friendly and funny and made sure we were taken care of. Buttttt the food itself was just ok and actually pretty overpriced for what you get. I had a turkey/chicken burger and fries and while the fries were actually pretty perfect the burger was not bad but was just ok and really not memorable or special in any way. My friend friend had the tuna steak which was actually pretty well spiced and had a good cook on it but her sides fell very short in flavour. Overall I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back or to recommend this place but I also wouldn't discourage anyone from coming here and trying it for themselves. I would probably only come back to sit outside and share a pitcher of Sangria and maybe an appetizer."
/user_details?userid=bAE1nK02S5je47YDzLleNw,Mundeep B.,"Mahwah, NJ",1 star rating,"Worst meal of the trip.  YELPERS let me down once again.  Service is super slow, even non existent.  We waited 1 hour for our meal.. burger, chicken and mash, veg burger, fish and chips and tuna tartare. Was about to leave and ask for the check, but the food unfortunately showed up.  Everyone was disappointed in the food, except the wife who liked the tuna.  While we waited no one came around and asked if we wanted more drinks or to check on us.  Only thing that came quickly was the check.  We thought the decor looked nice, but that's about it.Hope this place goes out of business or burns down."
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I find that this place serves ok food, ok cocktails, ok service... All in all ok. A bit on the pricey side. I am not so keen on recommending this restaurant."
/user_details?userid=b4MtJfkglnz3OR1XB5_eyA,Mieke W.,"Greenwood, Canada",4 star rating,"This meal was one if the best that I have had. I had the duck risotto which was not on the menu, but was the special of the night. I was NOT disappointed. The service was good and the menu had English notes for us non-French diners. I would also highly recommend the beef tart-tar! Fantastic!The only reason I removed a star is because after we paid our bill, the waitress let us know that the service was not included in the bill. We had already left her tip on the table, so it rubbed me wrong that the waitress felt she should ( and could?) ASK for a tip. A small thing at the end of a great meal but it left a sour taste in my mouth."
/user_details?userid=s1KRrtM9MTtFCODznt4vAA,Hy P.,"Ville-Marie, Canada",4 star rating,Great place for sangrias on the Terrace. They have several sangria flavours and all of them are great. Their menu is also pretty strong - though some items are a little pricey.

Good place for cocktails as the evening develops. Located in the middle of the action on St Catherine, it's got a great outdoor seating area."

/user_details?userid=u_AFp5wxDwbg8pF41wX_Ig,Mark B.,"Glendale, CA",1 star rating,"There's not enough alcohol in Montreal to excuse the absolute negligence and systemic failure of this food establishment. Not sure where to begin as my party of 10 wanted only to rid themselves of this experience. Incredibly poor service, blatant disregard for patrons, and a complete lack of food organization, management or anything close. Ultimately only 4 of us actually ended up with meals. This place gives food and Montreal a bad name. And that's a shame in a city of French. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WALK, WANDER OR STUMBLE INTO THIS PLACE. YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!"

/user_details?userid=ug4_HGDF8R9j13uV69Jw4g,Angel Of Agon Y.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"The Rebel Brasserie Urbaine is part of the gay Skye entertainment comlex, but the restaurant clientele seemed to be mixed when I was there for lunch recently. For those with long memories, this place used to be called ""Food."" It's been completely redone and the menu has been upgraded, although I miss Food's sushi bar. The new room is sleek and modern. There's copious outdoor dining as well. For lunch I had a delicious salmon tartare, a filling burger de poulet et canard, and an excellent cup of coffee. As befitting a gay venue, the wait staff ranges from pretty to gorgeous. But, unlike their New York and Los Angeles counterparts, the boys are without snotty attitudes. My waiter Laurence was not only fetching, but attentive and courteous. Perfectly bilingual and a student at McGill, he was intelligent and friendly. Laurence added to the ambiance of the whole experience."

Highly recommend it! Salmon tartar was excellent and so was the Beef Carpaccio....And the DESSERT POUTINE IS A MUST."

/user_details?userid=9VC0TgH-WEbXhyNHtWMstg,Lily N.,"Richmond, Canada",4 star rating,"We came for dinner with our kids last week. The street had many restaurants but this one had a nice French bistro menu. We ordered shrimp bouquet, naan with sour cream and truffle oil, duck breast main course, beef and salmon tartare, beef short rib linguini. Everything was so good. The only improvement could be with the shrimp bouquet. It came in a fake plant in a pot, with long skewers of breaded shrimp on it. The shrimp tasted fine, but the presentation in the pot was a bit dusty. The pot container felt a bit oily and sticky. Not sure how many other bouquets came out in this pot and whether they clean it between customers. The naan was also a bit heavy and oily. Overall, it was a great meal. Friendly service and nice atmosphere."
