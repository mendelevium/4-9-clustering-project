My brother and I are Vietnamese so we wanted to try our cultural cuisine in Montreal and decided to visit this restaurant.It's an interesting location because you actually descend/take a few steps into the restaurant so it felt somewhat underground and not so properly ventilated, but that concern was gone at the end of our experience.My brother got the traditional pho and he liked it (sorry, I did not take a picture of it). The two pics that I posted were the meals that my boyfriend and I had ordered. My boyfriend got  Banh Xeo and he enjoyed it a lot! I got the Banh Hoi Thit Nuong which is like a glorified spring roll setup and I loved it! The portions were huge and the ingredients tasted fresh! The grilled pork was well-seasoned with that characteristic char to it and the fish sauce was excellent (you can determine the authenticity of a Vietnamese restaurant by how well they make their fish sauce and pho in my opinion). The service was great meaning we actually had our drinks refilled and the prices were fair. I would definitely come back here again for that spring roll dish!"
/user_details?userid=EpIlKrJJBOkBrX01Ms-i0Q,Chris L.,"Westfield, NJ",4 star rating,"Had a great dinner with Boo Boo on a busy Saturday. Seems like the other Viet restaurants don't accept card so we took a chance here. We were able to be seated after a short wait. They are short staffed. The waiter was the bus boy, runner, bean sprouts basil, lime distributor, and the cashier. We shared the crepe and it waaaaay better than Ive had in Jersey. The portion was huge and it was crispy. There were mint, and 4 other herbs I never had. Maybe 1 was morning Glory and the other may have been sesame leaves. I got the #9 large and boo boo got the #9 medium. When we were seated they brought us hot tea and I also requested water and ordered our food to speed things up for him. I'm amazed the 2 guys understood, Viet, french, English and Cantonese. The bathroom available.We got up the counter to pay and we saw a sign saying cash or debit only. I gave him my cc but he didn't check and it processed like normal and I just have to add the tip and sign. This place is great. I feel places like this get a poor review because its in a touristy spot and the westerners feel they need to be served like royals. Don't let it being in the basement deter you from dining here. The water was not very tappy compared to the hand pulled noodle spot across the street."

I've been to Vietnam a few times and couldn't find a proper pho in Montreal. This place offers the closest you'll get to what pho actually tastes like in Vietnam. I also had their green curry chicken, which was good, and the spring rolls, which were okay. Their portions are very generous and the owner is really friendly. They now have a new regular customer!"
/user_details?userid=Y1zlQuRT31BH-p38U59ZVw,Jody W.,"Gansevoort, NY",4 star rating,"I would like to relocate this place to a few minutes near my house, please??First-the Chinatown area in Montreal is awesome. Lots of restaurants, dumpling spots and shops to purchase Chinese herbs. But there are also authentic Vietnamese restaurants in the neighborhood and I couldn't wait to give one of them a visit. There is one Vietnamese place fairly close to Saratoga....which is awesome.....but the owners are actually from Thailand. I've been craving really good Vietnamese for a long time, and I had some yesterday.We kept it simple with shrimp rolls, Pho and wonton noodle soup. Everything was so fresh, served piping hot and the flavors really popped. The soups are offered in different sizes: small, medium and extra large. The medium size is rather gigantic and more than generous portion-wise. The pot of tea was also perfect. The staff was awesome. When we arrived, it was just before 11:30am. It started to get quite busy after noon..so we timed it just right."

We arrived around 3pm on a Saturday. The restaurant is pretty clean, although it's a little dim (it's underground). The restaurant looks like it's family run, and the service was decent. We shared a medium pho with all the toppings, and it was delicious, but there was a lot of msg. I'm sensitive to msg, so on the bus ride home, my mouth was bone dry and my tongue was numb. Not a fun experience!  We also ordered a Che Ba Mau (3 coloured dessert made with coconut milk, grass jelly and red bean). It was a little sweeter than I'm used to, and made my throat a little itchy. They're pho is decent, but beware if you are sensitive to msg!"

We both got a medium bowl of pho with everything in it (I think it's item number 9). It was my first time eating pho and I found it quite good. I thought the portion was very large, but my boyfriend, a pho connoisseur, said that they're on the smaller side. The noodles were very good and flavourful, but the flip side is that the broth was way too intense for me. There was a lot of MSG. The price was very good (10$ after tax). The service was also prompt and respectful. We also got a 3 coloured drink as a dessert. It has coconut milk, a green thing and red beans. Sorry, I can't remember what the green thing was. It was very good! I would recommend that! I don't think I'll go back, but it's definitely worth a try if you're craving pho!"
/user_details?userid=VtiHkMISkk69btfo_s0cYw,Luis G.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Pretty surprised by the quality of the food and the price. I ordered a shrimp spring roll and a grilled beef vermicelli bowl and they were both great. Complimentary tea to add a plus to the service.
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Clean, tidy and spacious place. They have a large menu. So many to choose from. I had a bowl of satay beef. I like the spicy taste which comes from special chopped chili sauce. This keeps the broth clear and flavorful. You can choose rice noodle or egg noodle in your soup. I think egg noodle is more Chinese style to me. If you want to try a new combination, egg noodle is more chewy."

I'm from NY so I've had my fair share of pho experiences - this, was one of the best bowls of pho I've ever had. I don't know what crack is in their soup but it was so flavorful my sister and I drank every last drop of it. (We shared #9 which I believe is the special pho?? and the spring roll with shrimp - pretty avg, but the peanut sauce was subpar...)"

/user_details?userid=1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA,Calvin S.,"Winnipeg, Canada",4 star rating,"3.5/5, +.5 for serviceTo lay it all open, this place is definitely worth a try. There are several Vietnamese places to try in Montreal's Chinatown, but this place stood off due to the reviews and the fact that the menu is quite diverse.You have to walk down a set of stairs to reach the restaurant entrance, and there is no elevator so if you need accessibility assistance...you may be out of luck. I took away half a star for that, though I do understand the constraints of opening restaurants in the downtown core.When my family and I arrived at around 11:30am on a Sunday, the restaurant was quite empty, though by the time we left it was about 3/4 full. Either way, there's definitely business here and I can see why considering the food quality.I didn't know what to order at first, but after looking at the diverse options here, I went with the banh canh cua (thick noodles in crab soup), as not many Vietnamese places have that (or let alone, do it properly). To share with my family, I added a beef rice paper roll, since I wanted to try something a little different from spring rolls.The banh canh cua came first, and I was glad with the fact they use real Vietnamese transparent noodles, instead of cheap udon that I've had in other Vietnamese restaurants. The noodles were a little soggy for my liking, as I'm used to the thick noodles being a bit chewy, however it still tasted very good. The broth was also quite flavourful, but also not very MSGy as I didn't have the thirsty feel after.The rice paper roll was actually a do it yourself project, and was quite a unique experience. The server will teach you how to dip the rice paper into the warm water, then put the meat, vermicelli, veggies, and finally wrap it into a roll. We messed up a few times and ended up making tacos and burritos, but eventually we got the hang of it. Either way, the beef paper rolls tasted very good, and definitely something I would order again.My parents were all satisfied with their noodle soups, although the satay beef noodle soup is actually very spicy...thought I'd give you a heads up.Service was excellent, and the employees I found were very hardworking, as there were only two people running the shop during the time I was there. I'm sure they have more people, but they were very efficient."

I ordered the green papaya salad and a bowl of pho and unfortunately I would have to say that the pho was not very memorable, although not bad. I thought that the papaya salad on the other hand was beautifully presented and tasted great! Would give 4 stars for that but one star off for the environment and the pho."

My first time to try Pho is here, and before eating I haven't expected too much, but who knows, i love it right away! So amazing!

The pho was not hot enough and the broth did not have any taste. The beef was not tender and the meatballs were tasteless. Coming from an asian family, I know what good pho is. The shrimp my friend took was spoiled and smelled bad. I do not recommend this place."
/user_details?userid=kVjvWvYSmaOXVSchdGIE5A,Nhu N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I would say the special Pho was ok, the broth was  well seasoned, the meat was tender, not bad but not that impressive either. The Bun Bo Hue was not as delicious, I personally find 'Mam ruoc' overpowered the broth so you couldn't taste the flavor released from the bones of the beef (if they do make the stock using this method). Overall, it was enough to satisfy my tummy, considered this is the first Vietnamese Pho restaurant I've been to and I ordered the small size too!"
/user_details?userid=PuZ8bxmSWOKEgYXecukmww,Lissan C.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Been here twice and both times I was content and satisfied. I had Pho Bo the first time and Bun with Grilled Pork the second time. Authentic Vietnamese classic is what u get, not modified or westernised. Broth of the Pho soup was great, light, aromatic and flavourful. Comes in 3 different sizes which is great for small or big eater. The bun salad was fantastic too, paid an additional $1 for adding spring rolls in the bun salad. Service was humble and pleasant since the place is run by a family. I saw a little girl and her brother prepping the skin for the spring rolls at a table near the cashier/kitchen doors, reminds me of food vendors in most Southeast Asian hawkers. Ambience is very homey, nothing fancy, feels like an Asian family's home. It's clean and basic. Location of the restaurant is downstairs, it doesn't look attractive from the outside and sometimes it looks a bit deserted but once u r inside, u will see tables hidden in the corner row of tables and u will see all the Asians regulars eating their noodles. Price is very affordable for the quality you get. Will definitely be back if I visit Montreal again."

/user_details?userid=WKGgo72Z5dNZxifSV53Wsg,SzeYun L.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Want to give this 4.5This little restaurant is kind of easy to miss. As I walked past here twice looking for the restaurant from across the street. Their sign is blocked by either a tree or lamp post- I don't remember. When we spotted it we quickly crossed and went right in. Watch out for the steep short steps down. And make your way into this small single front door that once perhaps pristine white. When we walked in, we began to question what made this place rated so highly. This little restaurant that sat at the bottom of the stairs. It's not anything fancy inside - it's like any over used and rarely updated Asian restaurant. Although they do have a tv there to keep you visually entertained while you wait for your order to arrive.Then you eat the food. You MUST try the Pho!Wow! Hello broth! Perhaps the best I've had in a while! Or ever ?! Yeah that good. i ordered number 13 small. Although I didn't feel completely full upon finishing I did after finishing half the three bean with coconut milk dessert drink. Everything was so good and I left very happy. I'm unsure if this restaurant is wheelchair accessible."

The soup was so umami I almost finished but was too full. Fried spring roll wasn't impressive -- tasted more like a Chinese fast food spring roll. Vietnamese coffee was good but disappointed they don't let the coffee drip in front of you. Will definitely go back!
/user_details?userid=4jRbtVIieuBbSBJWDhP3jw,Anthony N.,"Burnaby, Canada",4 star rating,Being from Vancouver I always found the pho in Montreal expensive and not filling. This place is fair for the quantity (biggest pho dat biet) compared to other places and the broth is unique and full of flavor.  I'd pass on the Imperial roll and try something else.  Too greasy and uninteresting inside.Very friendly family place!

Very crispy imperial rolls too. I told the male server I was mildly allergic to shrimp and the moment I tasted the dipping sauce, I could taste shrimp and was concerned because I didn't have my epipens on me but that's my fault. I was the only one in there and the male server would not come over to me despite having an empty dish and drinking a whole pot of tea by myself. He told me that I did not leave a big enough tip of $2 on an $9.75 bill, flustered and enraged, I gave him a handful of change of around $3"

Comes in different flavors and always make you feel full: physically and psychologically! So yeah, you need some culinary skills (haha not really) to wrap the spring rolls that you want.

/user_details?userid=2FywH1DoTKMwXMRz1DPwPw,Kitana Q.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"1. Food: the best pho we've had, hands down, even including what's available in NY. The broth is dark with herbs and flavor, and the meat pieces are thinly sliced. No need for hoisin or sriracha. The grilled chicken over vermicelli was also one of the best I've had. Tender dark meat slices, cucumber and carrot slices. Summer rolls came with a delicious sweet peanut sauce. Main dishes priced from $8 - $12. 2. Atmosphere: downstairs, very informal and casual. TV in the back. Families and couples.3. Service: good, no complaints."

First it was a display of poor hygiene by waiter who had to rub his inner nose with his fingers. Next up the bathroom, the dirtiest, nastiest bathroom in north america.

/user_details?userid=M1Xr7clDvoUSM7zSdnZplA,Timothy D.,"Brookline, NH",3 star rating,"When my wife and I came to Montreal for Osheaga 2013, she took an afternoon shopping and I went to Chinatown for Pho.  I did not come here, but instead crowded into another Pho place where you had squeeze between lines of other customers at family-style tables.  This time, (September 2014) the wife joined me and we had little gremlins in tow so the prospect of waiting to find a seat for all of us sent us here.  We arrived for an early lunch and were seated quickly.Know that Pho Saigon is located below strew level, and the steps to reach it are narrow and steep.  Take them slow and easy, especially in the winter.The restaurant is clean and neatly appointed.  It features very simple and tasteful decor, and at the time it was not too cluttered. There's a flatscreen TV on the wall, which we could pretty much care less about. Since we were there before the lunch crowd, the service was very quick.  One of my gremlins loves Pho Ga, the other is more into noodles, so that's what they ordered.  My wife and I had Pho Bo Vien (if I remember correctly).Here's the thing, the food was good, no doubt.  Hot, fresh, and tasty.  However (and you knew this was coming), on this particular day, and with our Pho, it was not transcendent. If you're a Pho-lover, then you know it's all about transcendence -- the full umami mouth feel, the savoriness of the broth, the distinctive clash of meat, noodle, and vegetable textures, all punctuated by the sting of the lime, peppers, and sriracha. Sadly, we did not feel that the Pho we had (on this day) possessed that transcendence.  It was tasty.  We enjoyed it, but did not feel compelled to drain the bowls as we have at other places.But please, you must try it for yourself.  Palates vary, and it's quite possible we arrived too early and the broth just hadn't ""hit it"" yet.  Also know, that as the lunch service gets busier, service slows down, as can be expected.Great prices -- a family of four for $35 is on of the best values you'll get in Montreal.Oh and before I forget, there's no booze.We'll be sure to try it again and edit the review if necessary."

/user_details?userid=VXbi8ndacawnd6kidQF8dw,Marie P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Great spring rolls and pho! We had the shrimp and chicken roll plus the pork roll.  We had the special pho and the beef balls and rare beef pho. Everything was quite tasty. Good place to stop by if your in the hood.
/user_details?userid=jhTtZbkU9f_L1EgsoTV1zw,Maxine L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My friends and I call this restaurant ""the basement"". We always go eat pho there or to another one down the street. It's basically our chilling spot since we all love pho so much! The only thing they put on TV is the Just for Laughs pranks, which gets a bit repetitive. It takes some time until the food comes, but that doesn't make the food less good."

/user_details?userid=Nl2S67CsS6RMV6BJEzHvJw,Peter G.,"Boston, MA",2 star rating,"Maybe it was our mistake for not getting the Pho or maybe it was because the B-Team was in the kitchen that night - but about the only good thing at our visit was the service.The food was remarkably flavorless, which for a fresh cuisine like Vietnamese was a first for me. The shrimp that appeared in a number of our dishes was soggy and flavorless, reminiscent of the too-cheap frozen variety. The shredded pork was dry, gritty and tasted off. Our food was only occasionally punctuated by the fresh taste of basil or mint - but otherwise was just not good.The service, however, was excellent. Our waiter was cheerful, efficient, and welcoming. He switched right to English when he heard my girlfriend and I trying to work our dubious French. I have to wonder if something was off that night in the kitchen, especially given the other reviews and an experience like this in a city known for its excellent Vietnamese cuisine."
/user_details?userid=xFt9Fuhq1sQAVZv6_R1lwQ,Yiatin C.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Really really good pho. We were craving pho while visiting Montreal and came here. It's right on the main strip, one flight below street level. The place is spacious and clean. The sauce bottles weren't dripping from usage. I had #11 rare beef and brisket; the small size was good for me. The beef was fresh and sliced thin. The noodles were perfectly done and the accoutrements were so fresh. Now the broth - flavorful and clean, really outstanding. I highly recommend this restaurant."
/user_details?userid=F1CxK5sx7Wp1Zi3qgPjHUQ,Kimberley M.,"Kingston, Canada",4 star rating,"We came in here based on the stellar Yelp reviews and high star rating. The Pho was amazing. Spring rolls, too. It's been a long time since I've tasted a bowl so good. Service is a bit... spotty, but in a weird way, the order mixup we experienced seemed to add to the charm of the place. The bottom line: I'll be back here the second I return to Montreal."
/user_details?userid=5A0v9_EPFhysm5Yj28X9zw,Han T.,"Edison, NJ",5 star rating,"Came here for authentic Phô and authentic it was. One of the best phô ever tasted. Don't pay attention to the decor, or lack of. It's your typical outdated phô joint but the authentic phô makes up for it."
/user_details?userid=9k16c9_Xc4yztxzo4ELMKg,Morris M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5 star rating,"I have had many a pho bowls before, but this one was the real deal.  Located in Chinatown in somewhat of a seedy looking storefront is this amazing restaurant with spectacular food and even better service. I loved it and everything was very authentic. And even better, my bowl was only $10. And it was more than enough food too.  Montreal cannot be the most affordable place to eat, but this place helps a lot."
/user_details?userid=wPT7Uxcn0IMxnPa7AM-NWg,Priscilla L.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",4 star rating,The only place that serve spicy vietnamese soup all week. The decor is so so but the food and service are quite good.
/user_details?userid=-4pYtFJbZYzKqmiOjGr4ag,Albert N.,"Mile End, Canada",5 star rating,This hidden gem in the Chinatown strip is not to be overlooked. Amazing homemade meals with friendly staff. A lot of authentic style viet dishes you dont see everyday.

/user_details?userid=-KpEgEen1tj-jdjIS7uVOw,Isabelle R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Looking for delicious pho in Chinatown? Pho Saigon is it. The broth was tasty, not oily in the least, the meat was tender, and everything was super fresh. Do not omit the spring rolls- YUM. They were so delicious, by far some of the best I've ever had- make sure to get a double order! The staff is friendly and accommodating, the decor simple, slightly neon-ised and in a basement but hey, you can't ask for everything. I will be returning. Pho sho."
/user_details?userid=veArHaYgD9L2vdjp8UhHNw,Jon L.,"Richmond, Canada",4 star rating,"A solid four stars for us on a cold, windy and snowy evening.  The pho with beef was good and the broth was nice although a bit heavier than we are used to.  The spring roll was really really good.. almost ordered some to go on the way out!   Rice meal #50 had all the meats except chicken, which interestingly they don't offer with any other meats as a combo, and I finished it all."
/user_details?userid=c7C5QziJbx6JOnQFiOxUXQ,Youri H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Probably the best phö spot in Montreal, but don't tell anyone. Okay, maybe tell one or two people, and then start a super secret phö gang with them. And then, as your gang grows stronger, invite a few more people to join. Eventually, your gang will be so powerful and this restaurant will be so popular that they'll need to open a second location... but don't tell anyone about that one."
/user_details?userid=K_H2SLOudDpujs2cTgPRzg,Joshua K.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"This is the best Pho in Chinatown (and I've tried them all!).  Not nearly as rushed as the other Pho places on Saint-Laurent, nor as crowded and loud.  Prices are similar and food is better!  They're the only one with seafood soup and I think the only ones that sell egg noodles (they call them yellow noodles) along with the standard rice ones.Great spot for Pho in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=5AV4-WoHeZb2hMHn_nfp2g,Eniola A.,"Calgary, Canada",1 star rating,"Was in Montreal for my friends birthday and chose to have diner here based on the reviews. Service was okay nothing special, that could also be because we got there 45 minutes to closing time. I ordered the Basil stir fry with shrimps and rice because I wanted to try something different. Bad idea. I got 4 small pieces of Stale shrimps  that  had already gone bad and a whole bunch of vegetables. I was so disappointed! The only good thing about dinner were the emperor rolls which I loved! 1 star."

It's on the sweet side, not overly salty like you can get in other places. A plus is this place is a clean, friendly family place. VN iced coffee pretty good too."
/user_details?userid=iQqnOowa5PoyRAInocwXfw,Alex A.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Best pho I've ever had, and I eat a lot of pho. It's all about the quality of the broth, and this place has it. Don't let the semi-hidden basement location put you off, those are usually the best places anyway."
/user_details?userid=yKPDBC4kd5zMuTFQXIt-Fg,Jessi N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I've tried all the pho places in Chinatown because we live nearby and this place is definitely the best! We eat here almost every week! They make their pho broth from scratch so the flavours are really rich and authentic. It's really inexpensive too- probably why we go so often. Most of the meals are under ten bucks. I really like the Beef Satay Pho and the grilled pork chop meal.
/user_details?userid=lgnIj-zzklgPi-r7ojPbjA,Peter F.,"Manhattan, NY",3 star rating,"Perfectly fine vietnamese place in Chinatown. Clean looking, if pretty simple decor. Spring rolls fresh and flavorful. Soups were large and tasty, if not strikingly unusual. Service was fast and pleasant. Atmosphere tended towards florescent lights with a tv on the wall showing some version of Candid Camera. Still a fine choice with young kids and the prices are reasonable. Certainly no worse than anything else on the street and better than some, no doubt."
/user_details?userid=siCkQhJcmmUzOq6qUTCUhA,William Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I was never a big fan of pho, but I really like this place. $10 gets you a big bowl of pho topped with beef. Unlike other phos, the soup in this place actually has a flavor. Also, the hot sauce they provided on the table does not taste sour at all."
/user_details?userid=8BqhbCGio599rFGVa8GzQg,CA F.,"West Covina, CA",5 star rating,"It's downstairs. Yes, decor is spartan, but staff is so friendly. My wife and I had beef and chicken pho, respectively, and shrimp+veggie rolls (not fried). Pho was not overly salty :-) There is a secret spicy sauce you have to ask for. C'est en bas. Il n'y a pas de décorations, mais les serveurs sont amicaux. Il y a une sauce piquant secrète (no le Siracha, a table: un autre; demandez-le.)"
