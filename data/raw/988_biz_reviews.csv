/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm glad that this LaSalle staple is open for takeout and delivery! There's not a lot of good options in LaSalle but this one is a tried and true.  Service is always friendly. I usually go for the family combo with a full chicken, salad and choice of fries or rice for $28 with the sauce on the side.  They have spicy and non-spicy sauce.  The spicy sauce, which is only mildly spicy, is much more aromatic than the non-spicy one. The family combo is perfect for 4 people with a generous amount of rice.  The chicken is hacked into pieces and slathered in special sauce. Sometimes I wish the pieces would be a bit more grilled as only the wing tips have that crispy grilled flavor but not a big deal. You'll enjoy the same juicy tenderness in both the dark and white meat. Salad is simple and fresh. The rice is seasoned and goes nicely with the meal. Overall, a great reliable meal option when you don't feel like being adventerous/disappointed in trying something new but want the satisfaction of takeout--call these guys."

/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had been wanting to try this place for forever since I heard all the rave reviews after the Yelp Elite event I wasn't able to attend.When I ordered from here about a month ago, they had a limited menu, I believe due to COVID. We ordered a full chicken, a piripiri chicken poutine and a salad. Everything was delicious. Even though we ordered delivery, the meal came hot. Chicken was moist and they included extra sauce like we had asked. Price is reasonable but more expensive than the chain portuguese places. The quality is much higher so it makes sense to me. I'm looking forward to trying more dishes this place has to offer, especially their sandwiches!Tip: They sellout early on friday and saturday so call to order in advance if you can!!"
/user_details?userid=wW72FaqNPv6pdBC6AUqvcA,Hilary K.,"Vaudreuil-Dorion, Canada",1 star rating,"We were in the area and decided to give this place a try as we read the positive reviews and we are big fans of Portuguese Chicken!!! It's one of our favourite foods to have and we just adore traditional Portuguese chicken.Unfortunately, this place is far from good.. ugh the chicken was horribly dry so sad ! It was so dry I could've barely swallowed my chicken after chewing on it for over 5 to 6 times ! Seriously no amount of sauce could have hide the fact that the chicken was so overcooked and horribly done. It felt as if the chicken was re-cooked or probably reheated two times. It was not fresh at all and was re-used after a few days. The mixed greens in my salad was soggy as hellThe rice was dry and just grossThe chicken was horrible both the family dish and the one in my poutine and the sausage chorizo yuck just chewy and tastelessThe only good thing was their sauce but the actual meat was horrible and overcooked Fries were dry and burnt The only thing I liked was their natas and Lemon cookies those were very delicious lolThe service 1/5 very snobbish .. the staff seemed like they were better than god just rubbed us the wrong way. Service was very slow and kept blaming us for taking too long to order and didn't want to cook anything.. they blamed that they were closing soon and didn't have much food left. They were upset that we ordered some cod fritters as they had to use their frier and they didn't feel like doing it. It was 6pm and their sign said they close at 8pm what's the problem!!!!? Geeez It seemed like they didn't want us there and just wanted us gone. After spending like 80-90$ I expected a bit more than this crapNever ever again Avoid at all cost maybe just the deserts were good but don't expect good food it's a waste of money"
/user_details?userid=1zxXP-HfI3Ycsv7xuZanaQ,Michael K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Was in the neighbourhood and decided to give this place a try based on reviews .LocationBased in LaSalle not to far from the highway.ParkingLots of free parking in lotInsideNot too big and not too small.Very clean and simple decor I Liked the open kitchen.FoodChicken was so dry and over cooked I decided to give it to my dog to eat after I took off the sauceTheir peri peri sauce was good but not good enough to add moisture to the chicken.Was disappointed about the chicken because I love Portuguese chickenThe rice was dry and tasted reheated. Salad was basic and when you took off the tomatoes and onions the salad was mostly old and lifeless Poutine was ok. The overcooked chicken was in the Poutine  and the sausage was super dry.Cheese in the Poutine was maybe half a hand fullThe sauce was the only thing that was good but not good enough to cover up the restThe only highlights was the Natas. Was top notch and only thing that tasted fresh.We got six and should of gotten more of thatServiceSeemed like they did not want to be there as they were all staring at the clock. Every time a customer walked in they had a look in there face like f$&$&$&.Rushed and did not want to take time to explain. They tried very hard to push what was already ready and did not need cooking.Should of realized this and walked out . My bad
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Pretty good food and decent portion. I got the  1/2 chicken with spicy sauce, fries, salad, cod fritters and pastel de nata. The chicken was good, but the sauce wasn't spicy at all. The skin was very flavorful. The meat was good but some parts of the chicken were very dry. The fries were extremely oily, but the salad balanced it well. The cod fritters were pretty decent, and the pastel de nata were delicious."
/user_details?userid=YF3v4Kpyg_YZkb_RTqAKwg,Sarah T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Almost walked by this place, but I saw a constant stream of people walking in that I had to check it out. I am glad I did. What a good Portuguese chicken place! Such a hidden gem (it's hidden in a tiny strip mall). The chicken was cooked perfectly, nice and succulent. The French fries were nice and crispy. Perfect combo. I bet the poutine is delicious."
/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The quality and taste of the food here is just excellent. I got to try 3 of their sandwiches ( chicken, chorizo and porc) all 3 delicious! Their bread is fluffy and fresh. I also tried their chicken salad - loved the salad dressing. Their chicken with that sauce on the side is to die for. The poutine is one of the best poutines I've had in a very long time. It's packed with cheese , pieces of chorizo and their amazing sauce. Finger licking good. I enjoyed the cod fritters but would not have it again because the other dishes are so much more delicious. I had a nice espresso to finish and I took their heavenly creamy desert home because I was so stuffed from the meal. The owners Fabio and Vanessa are just two amazing people and they put their heart and soul into this business. Keep up the good work. I'll be back !"

I need more. Morrrrre chicken. I didn't really enjoy the chicken croquettes (filled with an interesting chicken-salad-esque filling), they just didn't do it for me. I also didn't really enjoy the chorizo which was very good, well made and well priced, but again, just didn't do it for me. It's the chicken here. The chicken. Get the chicken and the Natas and you will not be disappointed. Congratulations to Fabio and his amazing Viana team for making spot number 25 in Canada's Top 100 restaurants this year! Well deserved! Keep up the awesome work!"
/user_details?userid=CtBx4yk_QM8ClITgw94TPQ,Simon P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I forgot to take a photo because I devoured that thing. Lovely poutine, very very tasty, spicy, flavourful, loved it. Level of spice was just right, portion was good, really a solid poutine. I'll be back for more. Saving the 5* for Ma Poule Mouillee but this is quite close."
/user_details?userid=WDqOhDRoDrt1UtOlCaubzQ,Andrea S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,It had been a while I didn't go to a Portuguese restaurant since my last time I was disappointed by how dry the chicken was. This was not the case here and I'm glad I gave this place a try. I also had the Chorizo and it was exquisite!!I will be bringing all my friends here.
/user_details?userid=_SCMWxDMKCbFn-uZBakESw,George S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,Great new Portuguese spot in LaSalle (first one I've tried in Montreal outside of St. Laurent). The food and service were top notch and the prices were good value relative to the portions. Highly recommend and would definitely come again.
/user_details?userid=sI2YuGglRKz-HG8DrzVc9A,Joel J.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've passed by this place a few times but then I decided to check it out. Hidden inside a strip mall away from the main commercial arteries, it's easy to miss.Named after the owner Fabio's hometown of Viana, picturesque photos of which add to the lively decor, it has an impressive menu of authentic Portuguese-style food served by friendly staff.I opted for a large format Portuguese poutine, non-spicy. Let me tell you, it was a big heaping big bowl filled with crispy fries (a little on the salty side), cheese curds, tender grilled chicken and pork, gravy and their signature spicy sauce topped with a sprinkling of dry parsley.It was tasty and quite filling.The other menu items I've tried are the Portuguese fried whole chicken ($15.00 if ordered from their carry out only menu, but no fries and no eating it on the premises) and the half chicken from their sit down menu, with fries and salad.Definitely worth the visit."
/user_details?userid=KUzSS0uiCIlQIcJT63pjGw,Carlito B.,"La Salle, Canada",5 star rating,"This place far exceeded my expectations. Located in a small strip mall on a side street of Lasalle, i consider this place a great hidden gem. The food is great, the poutine was amazing. They really pack the chicken sandwiches with more meat than the usual downtown places (cheaper too). I ate it so fast I forgot to take a picture. What also makes this place great is that I didn't have to struggle to find parking and wait a ridiculous amount of time to order my food.the staff is super friendly and helpful."

/user_details?userid=5BPv5iUP34NsWlNa4t9syQ,Mateo P.,"Châteauguay, Canada",3 star rating,Great during the day but at night the food tastes different and off (way too salty). They ask for tips but it's similar to a fast food restaurant so it doesn't really make sense....
/user_details?userid=WtKbFPCwbFHOiDIOwTXgPQ,Speakerboxx J.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Very delicious food... Absolutely love their take on poutine. The sauce has a very light but tasty flavor. My daughter got the chorizo and she killed it, it was Soo good... I would absolutely recommend this place.."
/user_details?userid=0mWIH_OMxAQ21F1bIxQL5w,Sam C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"You have not had chicken until you had some here. Stumbled by accident via Yelp, and it starts my 2019 discoveries with a blast... A must try for the food, and the staff was very nice...!!! Word of caution... if you are driving with take-out and the awesome smell in you car, you will be speeding home for sure !!!"
/user_details?userid=125PUtswBbrQ07c-N7y6yw,Lee Q.,"Kingston, Canada",5 star rating,Friendly staff and very helpful. My wife and I shared the 1/2 chicken plate and it was more than enough.

/user_details?userid=Lyxh1sR7g7XXjly5Y6HqaA,Richard R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Just discovered this new Portuguese Grill restaurant near my house. I ordered the quarter breast with fries and salad, very reasonably priced and unbelievable taste. The chicken was bursting with flavor and juicy, and the fries were nicely seasoned. If you live in the area it's a must, even worth the trip if you're  not from the area. I'm very excited about this new restaurant because it saves me a trip from going to St. Laurent to get my Portuguese chicken fix. And nice job on the decor, small but cozy."
/user_details?userid=IJLktPI26hCmCaYDdKL1PQ,Stephanie B.,"La Salle, Canada",5 star rating,"Best Portuguese chicken I've ever had. We usually order the whole chicken, with rice and salad for take-out. They never disappoint. There desserts are quite tasty also. Friendly staff and owners. They even remember mine and my husbands name. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a good meal!"
/user_details?userid=L_DhUhGi3V5rdKQRbd1p6g,Bianca E.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Usually go to the plateau for Portuguese chicken, but having another option closer to home is great. The family meal with a whole chicken, fries and salad was well priced."
/user_details?userid=IzNTeGSXsG6pUAg55i39vg,Alan D.,"Lasalle, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,We are regular customers at Viana! Normally order the family meal - whole chicken with fries and salad; Also tried the Bolinhos de bacalhau and Febras (pork cutlets). Great food at great prices. Friendly service.
