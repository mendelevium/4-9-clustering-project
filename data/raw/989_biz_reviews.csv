/user_details?userid=qIqECjnASpbLf-r4tTNs9Q,Mieko O.,"Burlington, VT",5 star rating,"We stopped by here based on reviews and on our way back from Montreal to Vermont. We selected a mixed plate with beef and chicken. It included hummus with pita, rice, and soda. A good deal and the food was delicious. The service was great and the meal was filling."
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"If you guys live in the South Shore and have a craving for some Middle Eastern food, this place is a rare find! Located on Taschereau (near the old Pizza hut which just closed), I went today with my family, and got a very warm greeting from the owner. What a sweet man! We ordered a varied menu since we wanted to try different kinds of meals, including the lentil soup, the sushi shawarma, the burger, the chicken brochette plate and the koobideh kabab plate.While everything was yummy, my favourite meals were the chicken brochette plate and the koobideh plates. I can tell that their specialties are their grilled meats, hence the name ""flame"". Truly delicious and very filling portions for reasonable prices. The flavour of the meat and chicken was fantastic, and the texture was very tender. The saffron rice was lightly buttered and fluffy, a great contrast with the pickles, charred tomato, onions and dipping sauces on the plate. My favourite dip was the hummus. The sushi shawarma was fun to eat and very innovative concept-wise, served with hot sauce, hummus and garlic sauce. The lentil soup was also lovely, a great little appetizer before digging in.It's a clean space with many tables and some TVs with sports on. I would definitely go back when craving some delicious grilled meats and saffron rice - food that we can't find much of in this area. Do yourselves a favour and try it out!"

The food was delicious. One of the best hummus dip I have tasted so far. It was creamy and savoury! The meat grills were tender and juicy. The servings are quite generous. Pricing is adequate for the quality and amount of food we get. Planning to go back soon with the family for a nice dinner!

We tried this place out last week when it opened and were given such a warm greeting. The restaurant is a family-run business, the lovely girl who took our order was the daughter of the owner/chef who was so kind and hospitable, he came out of the kitchen to ask us how we found the food and quality. We had kibbeh and dynamite shrimp for starters (both were probably the best we have tried! The shrimps were huge and they are very generous with the portion size). For mains, I had the Koobideh plate which comes with delicious saffron rice, grilled tomato, hummus, garlic sauce and pickled turnips/onions etc. The husband had the Lebanese Kofta with yoghurt which looked amazing! It was presented so beautifully with spiced potatoes and a generous helping of 3 kababs which were extremely flavourful, you could taste all the fresh parsley and coriander - delicious! The interior is clean with a simple décor, perfect for families or couples. Great for a sit-down meal or takeaways as they also do burgers / sandwiches /shawarma too.Overall, amazing first experience - will definitely become a regular here!"

Son got the sushi shawarma which was hit. Vegetarian daughter got the falafel, which she enjoyed. I got the minced lamb kebab, with the garlic aioli was amazing! We are tourists, but next time we are coming through to Montreal, we would eat here again!"

We were missing some nice kebabs and grillades on the south shore ! With lovely presentation and served with allot of love ! I love to visit or to take out from this new restaurant ! Their mix grills is good for 2-3 people. And their portions are very generous.. The meats are well marinated, very fresh and cooked to perfection. The owner is usually always there and he makes sure you are satisfied and live the best of experiences.. Their packaging for take out is next level. Good quality of trays which makes it easy to transport and warm again at home if needed.  I will keep on visiting this restaurant with friends n family"

The grilled meats are worth waiting for a little bit longer. Take the family! They also deliver, which is awesome. Nice meal to have at home as well."

I had the chicken shawarma platter. It was really good and had a ton of meat and sides. It came with really good lentil soup as well. Husband and son had kabob platters with chicken, lamb and beef and really enjoyed them."
/user_details?userid=jO-xrZruVpsZ_EFG8TxCcg,Zeshan F.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,This has become one of my most favourite restaurants in Brossard. One of the hallmarks of this restaurant is their wonderful customer service. The owner is super nice and made us feel part of his family. I enjoyed their chicken koobodeh plate and cheeseburger. Their presentation of their dishes is nice as well. You can't go wrong with this resto.
/user_details?userid=m0_W4iHkNZddR0msFtXI4w,Winncie L.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Very very tasty food. The portion is decent, courteous staff. They look like a fast food place but they also offer sit-in service. It is winter now and the dining room was not very well heated so the food got cold too really fast, but it's understandable. I believe we got a complimentary salad which was very appreciated since the meal was meat oriented. We were 3 so we got the mix grill for 3 people which included 2 minced beef skewers, 2 minced chicken skewers, 1 chicken skewer and 4 pieces of tandoori chicken thighs. The hummus was smooth. Everything was quite delicious. Will come back again."
