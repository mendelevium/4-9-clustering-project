/user_details?userid=phP0uWsLm1Cs0z_LTdblWg,Naomi A.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Favorite restaurant in Montreal by far (and I've gone to all the top rated ones). Benny is the owner and he went out of his way to accommodate my very picky 10 yr old with chicken and fries (my son is a vegan, but thought the chicken was so good, that he would give it up and eat it anyways!)! The restaurant is completely intimate, perfect for date night. There were no other kids, but they happily accommodated mine so I didn't feel out of place or uncomfortable. I actually feel like I got a break from parenting by going there (always the sign of good service). Favorite things on the menu:zucchini chips with tzadziki, fish of the day, exotic salad  (can't say enough about the salad!), and of course, the Greek coffee at the end. I crave this food (and service) so badly out in San Francisco (where I now live). You'll never have a better meal, served by the nicest and most accommodating people, in a beautiful and authentic atmosphere."

And to top it off, some of the rudest and worst service you will find anywhere.Probably the worst restaurant in Montreal I have ever been to."
/user_details?userid=3_fQymeWWO77d0X_x7UBAw,Greg M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"This place is anti-semitic. BEWARE of supporting a place that supports hate. The owner made a comment to me (after been coming here regularly for 10+ years): ""all you jews are the same"" when I asked to order an appetizer. He thought I wanted it for free. Not sure why he would. Oh yeah, because he is a racist."
/user_details?userid=PUIxDNh0_CAMoJ4XZf277A,Tommy M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,This place was alright. The food was expensive though.I liked the food and the Greek food selection is abundant. I really like the lamb chops here and the Greek salad also. The food preparation time is lengthy and also expensive. This restaurant is located in a hidden area of Mont Royal neighborhood which makes it a bit inaccessible which I don't like. The place never seems to be crowded which tells me this place was not really popular or making any money.
/user_details?userid=iTsNPbQUfW89k-nk4XEt4w,Sandy P.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"Outstanding!! Everything is very fresh, always perfectly cooked and delicious. The fried dishes have a perfect crisp and not greasy. The octopus is the best in the city (and that includes Milos).  The swordfish is sensational and great lamb chops for carnivores. Not a cheap meal but good value when comparing other restaurants of this type. A must!!!"
/user_details?userid=elpOs40V4fJUX98SqUF_bQ,K A.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,This is a favorite place in Montreal. I go annually with a friend and we adore it. We always get the Greek salad (the feta is amazing) and some tzatziki and grilled fresh seafood. Shrimp or scallops are always fantastic here. There should be more reviews for Faros on Yelp.
/user_details?userid=Vp_C7oIxeztbd2PchNBOHw,D A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This Greek fish restaurant is the antithesis to Milos - cozy, nearly cramped seating in a low-ceilinged building tucked away on Fairmount on the Outremont side. The walls are a bit darker and adorned with fishing vessel paraphernalia and photos, and the whole thing gives off a very authentic, relaxed vibe. It's not the type of place you go to celebrate someone's graduation or wow a visitor, unless that visitor is some old leathery village fisherman from Greece. Then by all means, taken him there ASAP.The food is really good - portions are really big and the dish complexity is kept to a minimum, kind of the way a steakhouse focuses on isolating the steak. They do the same thing - you won't find reductions and confits and blended ingredients that normally never go together here. Just a huge chunk of snapper with a simple side dish.Sometimes, you just want an uncomplicated meal - Faros fits that bill perfectly. I highly recommend it!"
