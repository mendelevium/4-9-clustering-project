/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Maybe you wouldn't expect this longstanding brunch restaurant to ""transform"" from N'Oeuf to B'Oeuf in the blink of an ""egg"" - but it does just that - three nights a week. With that single letter change comes a menu of --- dinner --- proportions;From tasty and smart appetizers like beet hummus and Chorizo pops to a signature (recipe) onion soup, then onto a fresh revisited Caesar salad leading into AAA steak, various seafood and butter soft chicken dishes. Stands outs are the shrimp with saffron rice and fresh and distinguished (beef or salmon) tartar.Two dishes that are sure to warm you up are the seafood chowder which is bisque based but still quite filling, and their Poutine which is over the top huge - comes in about and 8"" iron skillet and fit for two or three to share. I definitely only made a dent in it. Note to self Poutine is much heavier when toppings added.Don't forget their excellent and sizeable chocolate lava cake to top it all off, but probably not on the night you order a Poutine for dinner. In that case they have a fruit plate (both in individual and group sizes). The family who run the restaurant being on site, makes for a good ambiance and surely shows their pride. In sum for a brunch restaurant to even attempt opening in the evening - shows real dedication - if there was such a thing a bonus star for that, they would get it. I hope with continued hard work the goals come true.Their dinner offering is more than could be expected, and of a quality that deserves tasting - not only imagining. Indeed what's new, is their dinner ""food""."

The service is excellent and the staff is so friendly. We had chicken and mac and cheese and shrimp and a few other things, all of which were delicious and had great presentation."
