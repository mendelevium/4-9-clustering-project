They did not have any vegetarian options but anyhow they accommodated our request of Rice,bean, amarillos, salad.Edit*They have vegetarian paella! And once again the food was excellent the second time."

A friend of ours which is half Cuban booked this place for her boyfriend's birthday party. We had the whole place for us (around 20 people). The dishes were amazing and they were ready quite fast and at around the same time, which was surprising for the amount of people we were for such an small kitchen. We felt like home, the owner was awesome, he was playing all the songs we asked for and we ended up partying the whole night there instead of going to another bar which was the original plan. What a great night."

It was packed at 2pm on a Saturday and smelled amazing and everyone was speaking Spanish, there was even a small group at the bar having midday beers and watching some game on the tv and laughing. Much action for midday.For $11 I had a plate piled high with super savoury soft slow roasted beef, beans and rice and salad and plantains. Everything was fresh and crazy tasty, the side salsa wasn't spicy but was delicious spooned on everything. The salad dressing tasted like Kraft Italian - could be wrong but anyway it wasn't the highlight. Loved it all anyway, and it was 2 meal-sized for me. The pork and chicken plates looked really great too. I don't think there's anything here for a vegetarian, heads up."

Well I was wrong! I ordered a plate that included braised cuban beef, fried chicharron, beans, rice, salad and plantain two ways. It was a huge portion for 14$ for dinner and 11$ at lunch. It also comes with this very delicious salsa which is just a touch spicy but more on the flavorful side. Everything was excellent and I felt extremely satisfied by the end. Cant believe I didnt try it sooner! I will be a regular here for sure! Highly recommend!"
