I had the spicy soup last time, excellent. This time was the chicken and shrimp on crunchy noodles. Another good meal. I recommend that you call ahead. The wait can be difficult when you're hungry and you smell the wonderful fragrances from the kitchen. Enjoy"
/user_details?userid=F6MPrQ5oxQL2Wq1v5ENDzA,Robert S.,"Providence, RI",2 star rating,Had the Pho (Number 20) and the beef was nice and tender but the broth was extremely salty.   I had to add water to finish the soup.

/user_details?userid=T90SZi0rgZYbHljrDsb3sA,Dimitri D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I have been here a few times and have been mostly satisfied with the food. First off, the prices are affordable.You can find some really good and flavorful pho here, offering a variety of options. A personal favorite of mine is their ginger chicken -- if you like ginger, you will not be disappointed as the ginger is very present in this dish, but never overpowering. Their crispy noodles with beef is also a fantastic option -- never salty, always bursting with flavor because of the great broth in which they serve the beef. The noodles soften up once you pour the beef and broth over them and a success story is created.Lyla is also a very good place for lunch; you can get a small soup and tea with your meal and this is about the same price as selecting the meal a la carte. Be sure to try their bubble tea, if you are a fan. There isn't any other place in the immediate area where you can find this so it's very convenient for us bubble tea lovers! Order some  food for pick up and get yourselves some bubble tea while waiting at the bar counter!Minor complaints include the lack of attention to detail. Some dishes are a little inconsistent in terms of the vegetables that the dish is made with. At times, there will be broccoli in my dish. Other times, the broccoli is nowhere to be found. Seems insignificant, but this is just an example. Omitting or adding an ingredient will obviously change the overall taste of the dish, so this is a little disappointing. Also, if you are planning to pick up some pho, take note: you can only order a large format for pick up. This is a little upsetting, as a small or medium pho at Lyla is sure to satisfy most people.All complaints aside, it is a unique establishment for Parc Extension."
/user_details?userid=p5AXKTixc9NleUnSizZJcg,Daniel L.,"Mount Royal, Canada",4 star rating,"One of many good vietnamese restaurants in town. The staff is young and dynamic and the ambiance is casual and friendly.This place is near my school, and so my go-to meal is the bun bo hue (hue-style noodle soup), and it is in my opinion one of the best in town. There are also many other great dishes, such as com ba mao (rice with 2-way porc and a fried egg). Lyla also have many traditional vietnamese meals. One of my favorites is the bot chien (fried rice cakes with eggs served with soy sauce).Overall, Lyla is a great place to discover vietnamese food without being too daring while respecting the classics."
/user_details?userid=JLdxmsngE7cjrwNT7zqgyQ,Clare L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Delicious bùn! I tried out their no. 40 which was a lemongrass grilled chicken and definitely was fragrant! I'll have to admit though, I was hoping that they would have had just a grilled chicken offering. One of my friends had the Bún bò Hu which is a spicy lemongrass soup with a thicker noodle and beef! (The soup was oh so flavourful) The other friend had the Tai Pho, and again, the soup was clear and tasty! We also ordered a trio of appetizers: vegetarian Ch Giò, Gi Cun, and a dried beef and green papaya salad. Each of the sauces that came with these appetizers were remarkable!"
/user_details?userid=be7meZBiaGfAqR_4OfRXuA,Sara M.,"Kingston, NY",4 star rating,"A yummy vietnamese option in the Parc-Ex area!  The pho is great, especially beef broth.  The vegetarian broth lacked a punch, but it could also have been that we went early in the day.  The staff is young, and works hard considering how busy the restaurant gets at lunch and dinner times.  The food is fresh and very affordable.  They also have really great candies to take when you pay!!"
/user_details?userid=N0jWtDtqJRt_8QhKWZLD_g,Nicolas B.,"Sherbrooke, Canada",5 star rating,"Best Pho in MTL no doubt. The staff is very clever and friendly. They have an amazing Bun Bo hue, not too spicy. Finish it off with their che ba mau! 15% off for students, couldn't ask for more!"
/user_details?userid=MO5cK_xTIbJpPNSceBW-Lg,Stuart H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Great affordable place and all the food is very fresh. I visit a lot as it is close to my house. Tried quite a few menu items but my favourites are the rare beef and brisket soup and their mixed dumplings and imperial rolls. Yum :)
/user_details?userid=DRVEe9OZqBox9iWgFyB8SA,Krista M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"If you are looking for Vietnamese in the Jean-Talon & Parc Ave. neighborhood this is a great spot. They have many delicious varieties of 'pho' on the menu as well as the 'bun' dishes (vermicelli noodles with salad and topping of your choice) and are all reasonably priced. I was initially off-put by the top-40 radio playing, but there were too many positive features to not make me a repeat customer - nice booths, friendly staff (family run!) and of course, fresh & delicious food. *Recommendations - Vegetarian pho and rice pancakes appetizer. BYOB."
