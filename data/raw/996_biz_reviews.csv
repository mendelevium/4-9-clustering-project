The actual cooking is done on a cooktop or a gas grill in the alley. The menu offers an eclectic selection of vegetarian dishes, seafood and a single choice for meat; from potatoes with garlic mousseline, eggplant with cherries and yogurt, to a pork chop with roquette, currants and goat cheese, it was hard to choose. Our group decided to order everything on the menu and share; the portions were perfectly suited to do so. We not only ordered everything but added more to our order as the food was just incredibly delicious! Perfectly seasoned and presented, every dish had incredible flavour combinations, and made with fresh and quality ingredients. The wine list was just as good with a limited but amazing selection of white, reds, bubbles and even the best orange wine I've ever had the pleasure of savouring! The service was great, and considering the size of the space used for prepping and cooking, the food arrived in constant stream; our waiter never missed a beat although he wore many hats including host, waiter, and bartender! The space is small and only around for the summer season so I do hope to return or see it back again next year, as this was an incredible discovery!"

And I was just as impressed with this year's offerings of perfectly grilled and seasoned vegetables, meats and sauces. Add to that a wine list featuring excellent choices to complement the delicious food and a unique ambiance. It all makes for a truly memorable night out. I hope to make it back to Le Parasol again before the end of the season. And i really hope this little gem is going to be back again next year, and every year after that!"
