The owners are extremely hospitable and warm, welcoming us with a big smile. Make sure to ask them the story behind this famous hanging bread!We ordered a philly cheese steak kaek and shish taouk kaek which was made to absolute perfection. Delicious flavourful meat with fresh vegetables and oozing with cheese! Each and every bite was heavenly. Whilst waiting for my order and watching the fresh bread in production, I had to take a bag of them home for myself! Cannot wait to return once things are back to normal to see their fresh vegetable salad bar and build my own custom kaek! Highly recommend if you are in the area (was worth driving from the South Shore for!)"

It has a huge oven and makes the bread fresh. There's a variety of fillings you can get, from savory to sweet (e.g. Nutella). We went today for a light lunch. The kaek was really good, freshly made with fragrant sesame seeds all over the surface. The dough had a nice chew near the ""handle"", and its thin hollow structure was perfect for fillings. We got the Royal Shishtaook, which contained grilled chicken, pickles, vegs, fries and a delicious sauce. Pretty good place to grab a quick lunch!"

If you are walking downtown and wanna grab a quick snack, you there they have a lot of choices!They also have one with nutella inside!"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",3 star rating,Newish place next to concordia H building that I almost overlooked.They sell these lebanese style sandwiches. Was pretty good when I went and it was a decent price ($8). I got the cheese option and It was good but I think what makes it just an ok for me is the cleanliness of the restaurant. It just looked really sad and unkept. But that doesn't really take away from the food  Food is a 3.5 stars.
/user_details?userid=JoVrzT6QTcTeRmXQdQg02w,Yvette G.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Little Lebanese place in front of Concordia University where they make sesame bread sandwiches. Interesting and original concept and their sandwiches are good. One sandwich is about 8$. They also offer unlimited tea!
/user_details?userid=vBd36PI_VVZYAkBZgSqwsA,Ahmad S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My favorite restaurant downtown! Authentic, inexpensive, and tastes fantastic. If you're really hungry try the chicken fajita or shish taouk. If you're looking for something light, my favorite is the labneh zaatar. You also get a free tea with your sandwiche! What else would you want?"

The bread is a Lebanese bread covered in sesame seeds. Lots of choices for fillings. They cooked the meat as you order. Overall, pretty good!"

This place is insane ! The sandwich is a bit messy and awkward to eat but it's really worth it ! The restaurant is a bit small but good for a quick bite or pick-up. Highly recommended!"
/user_details?userid=UF9C7dIsvItJe4TT7Quu7g,Jeannette W.,"Wick, United Kingdom",3 star rating,"Nice if you haven't tried ka'ek especially because the dough was plenty chewy. However flavour was lacking in some of the options. 4-stars for the Breakfast Ka'ek which was the best one of the three we tried, especially for the runny egg yolk."
